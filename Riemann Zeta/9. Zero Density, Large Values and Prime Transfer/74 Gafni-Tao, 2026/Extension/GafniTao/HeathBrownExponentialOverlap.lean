# Exponential overlap for a one-separated ordinate set

Heath--Brown's passage from Lemma 3 to equation (44) uses that translates
of `exp (-|x|)` have uniformly bounded overlap at unit-separated centres.
This file proves that assertion with the explicit constant four, by grouping
centres according to the integer part of their distance from the evaluation
point.  No height interval or cardinality bound is inserted.

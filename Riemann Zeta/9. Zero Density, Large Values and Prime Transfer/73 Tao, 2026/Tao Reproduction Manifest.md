# Tao 2026 Reproduction Manifest

## Manifest status

This is a development manifest, version `square-relation-maximal-order-0.28`. It
reproduces the source identities, pinned build environment, initial source
definitions, frozen Gafni--Tao theorem closure, and Tao's Proposition
2.3(i),(iii). It is not a main-theorem release manifest.

  `GafniTao.Theorem11`, with 852 `GafniTao`, 291 `RiemannZeta`, and 83
  `PrimeNumberTheoremAnd` source modules.
- Proved content: Proposition 2.3(i) from Mathlib's Bertrand theorem;
  definition-interface lemmas; the uniform discrepancy result
  `exists_uniform_dyadic_exceptional_power_guthMaynard`; exact control of the
  higher-prime-power tail; and
  `exists_dyadic_primeFree_power_guthMaynard`, which gives a nonnegative
  exponent strictly below one for the genuine variable-length dyadic
  prime-free endpoint measure; the finite dyadic assembly; the monotonicity
  treatment of `theta >= 1`; and `taoProposition23iii_guthMaynard`, which has
  the full source range and quantified `O(X^(1-c+o(1)))` conclusion. Exact
  proposition-valued conclusion contracts for Theorems 1.7--1.10 compile,
  but none is proved. The exact inclusive smoothness bridge, unique `p²m`
  representation of `B¹`, and finite identity
  `badOneTermCount_eq_sum_psiNat` are also proved and audited; Proposition
  2.1's analytic estimates and Lemma 1.6 remain open. The positive powerful-
  number `a²b³` parameterization with squarefree `b`, including uniqueness,
  is proved and audited as elementary infrastructure for Corollary 2.11. It
  also yields the exact finite squarefree-cube sum for `VB¹`. Dominated
  convergence, the unique square-times-squarefree reindexing, and Mathlib's
  Dirichlet-series formula for Riemann zeta prove the exact
  `ζ(3/2)/ζ(3) √x` asymptotic. All interval predicates now carry the source's
  `H≥1` convention, and the exact type-`F₃`/factorial-square endpoint
  correspondence is proved and audited. On finite ranges, largest-index
  projection is proved to have image exactly `F₃∩[1,x]`, giving the audited
  inequality `factorialThreeCount x ≤ factorialSquareTripleCount x`. The
  one-term set is characterized by square multiples of `s(a!)`; the square
  subfamily gives audited `⌊√x⌋-1` lower bounds for endpoints and triples and
  the full reverse-big-O half of their `x^(1/2+o(1))` scale contracts.
  The exact reduction from repeated factorial squarefree components to a
  square consecutive product is also proved; Erdős--Selfridge itself remains
  an explicitly open, source-pinned dependency.
  All three source-facing total counts are proved to decompose exactly into
  their nontrivial and one-term value counts.
  The `b=1` powerful-number family gives audited `⌊√x⌋` lower bounds for
  `VB¹` and `VB`, together with their reverse-big-O square-root lower halves.
  Termwise domination of the exact `VB¹` sum by the convergent `b⁻³ᐟ²`
  p-series gives the summable majorant used in the audited normalized limit;
  its squarefree p-series constant is proved equal to the public zeta ratio.
  The exact-once prime divisor lemma and the positive-start `H<N` conclusion
  of Tao's Lemma 3.1 are also proved; the documented `{1}` edge case prevents
  claiming the unrestricted wording verbatim.
  Lemma 3.2's canonical exponent-one coefficient/powerful-core split, its
  small-prime support, factorial divisibility, and exact two-position linear
  relation are proved. The exact coefficient-product divisibility, finite
  Abel/Chebyshev envelope estimate, two-half averaging, fixed-power coefficient
  bounds, and final nonzero-shift powerful relation complete the lemma.
  The finite powerful-pair count used in Corollary 2.11 is also reindexed
  bijectively by the unique square-times-squarefree-cube parameters, with its
  exact cardinality preserved. For Lemma 2.10, the coefficient product now has
  an audited squarefree-discriminant decomposition and every square-discriminant
  solution for any nonzero integer shift injects into the signed divisors of
  `a*h`; the resulting divisor-epsilon bound is proved. The literal
  `bm+cn√D` norm point is injective, and norm-one
  Pell solutions are proved to act on each fixed-norm fiber of `ℤ[√D]`. The
  fundamental unit's powers have a proved exponential coordinate lower bound,
  giving exactly `2 log₂(B)+1` candidate powers under a coordinate bound `B`.
  On every nonzero fixed-norm fiber, equality of generated principal ideals is
  proved equivalent to membership in the same norm-one Pell orbit. Each such
  principal ideal is also proved to divide `(N)`, so the ideal-divisor map has
  exactly the Pell orbits as its fibers. The Galois fundamental identity is
  specialized abstractly to prove that a prime has at most two primes above it
  in any Dedekind Galois extension with group order two. The concrete
  `ℚ[X]/(X²-D)` field is proved irreducible and quadratic, its square root is
  proved integral, and `ℤ[√D]` embeds injectively into the actual maximal order.
  Fixed-norm points generate members of a constructed finite set of ideal
  divisors of `(N)` there, with fibers exactly the maximal-order association
  classes, and the two-primes-above bound is instantiated for this concrete
  order. The sharp `d(|N|)²` ideal-divisor cardinal bound and transfer of the
  power bound to height-bounded elements of each maximal-order unit orbit—and
  hence the complete quantitative lemma—remain open.

## Reproduction command

From this node directory:

```powershell
cmd /c run_tao_build.bat --no-pause
```

The command verifies:

1. required project files;
2. all four pinned source artifact hashes (Tao PDF, Tao TeX archive,
   Baker--Harman--Pintz PDF, and Erdős--Selfridge PDF);
3. all 1,226 frozen dependency hashes and the exact frozen source file set;
4. the raw-only Mermaid architecture contract;
5. the exact Lean, Mathlib, and imported package pins;
6. direct production-root import coverage and forbidden-shortcut absence in
   production and frozen source; and
7. the warning-free `Tao2026` build and executable axiom audit.

The runner emits no persistent log. Console success is evidence only for the
checkout on which it was run.

## Not yet reproducible

The source crosswalk records the initial definitions, main targets, and proved
Proposition 2.3(i),(iii). There is no proved public endpoint for Theorems
1.7--1.10 and no main-theorem proof release to reproduce. The present
axiom audit covers every current Tao production theorem but is not a substitute
for the eventual public-endpoint release audit.

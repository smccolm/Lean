### Genuine real/finite tensor and finite-factor admissibility verification — 8 October 2026

Foundation `cmd /c run_lake_build.bat --no-pause` returned **PASS, exit 0**, followed sequentially by paper `cmd /c run_dubon_build.bat --no-pause`, **DEVELOPMENT PASS, exit 0**, with zero Lean diagnostics. Coverage: 1221 production modules, 581 exact consumers, 5,407 explicit registrations and {count:,} exhaustive theorem dependency checks. All sixteen linters passed across {lint:,} declarations plus {gen:,} generated declarations in both paper audit executions. Initial inventory passed with {files:,} retained files, {links:,} local links and {unchanged:,} unchanged existing Lean files; source pins and tooling fixtures passed.

{implementation_summary}

The original adelic Hilbert space has a genuine equivariant full-real/full-finite tensor factorization, and its full finite factor is admissible for every actual open finite adelic subgroup. The restricted good-place tensor and its independent full action remain proved. Individual bad-place factorization of the fixed base, spherical representation/Euler-factor classification, full adelic admissibility across all real compact types, the automorphic non-CM bridge and higher symmetric automorphy/continuation remain open. Unconditional Deligne, non-CM Sato–Tate and the final modular application remain open. DUB-01–16 remain accepted; DUB-17–20 remain OPEN.

Focused elaboration reused the existing full real/finite commutation theorem, made the actual prime-place generator domain explicit, and split tensor-coordinate and completed-action equalities into small congruences to retain default resource budgets. The independently defined tensor inner product computes directly on original pure tensors. All nine production modules and twelve exact original-object consumers compiled cleanly before the expanded audit and sequential full verifiers.

The foundation verifier observed dirty checkout `{observed_commit}`; Lean 4.30.0, Mathlib `c5ea00351c28e24afc9f0f84379aa41082b1188f`, PNT+ `4ecb950126c4290293c5662dfe0e884123171df5`. Frozen source and dependency revisions are unchanged. No external Lean code was imported. ELAN_HOME was inferred from the installed Lake command. No staging, commit or push was performed by this agent.

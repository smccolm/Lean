### Original quotient L2 closure and integral cusp average verification — 7 October 2026

Foundation `cmd /c run_lake_build.bat --no-pause` returned **PASS, exit 0**, followed sequentially by paper `cmd /c run_dubon_build.bat --no-pause`, **DEVELOPMENT PASS, exit 0**, with zero Lean diagnostics. Coverage: 723 production modules, 301 exact consumers, 3,443 explicit registrations and {count:,} exhaustive theorem dependency checks. All sixteen linters passed across {lint:,} declarations plus {gen:,} generated declarations in both paper audit executions. Initial inventory passed with {files:,} retained files, {links:,} local links and {unchanged:,} unchanged existing Lean files; source pins and tooling fixtures passed.

Five modules and four exact consumers identify the completed representation isometrically with the exact closure of the original cyclic quotient L2 range. The original generator retains its Petersson norm, nonzero value for every nonzero form, compact weight character and dense cyclic span. Genuine Fourier extraction and periodic integration prove zero averages for every positive strict period and offset. Actual principal-level slash transforms prove zero common-level-Q unipotent averages at every integral cusp for every original continuous algebraic cyclic vector.

These are unconditional statements about the original quotient realization, original generator and actual continuous cyclic functions. No pointwise cusp period is asserted for arbitrary completed L2 equivalence classes. Adelic cuspidal globalization, irreducibility and higher symmetric continuation remain unproved. Unconditional Deligne, non-CM Sato–Tate and the final modular application remain open. DUB-01–16 remain accepted; DUB-17–20 remain OPEN.

The foundation verifier observed dirty checkout `a6b9fb6e673f992be69233a9c452d9db2ce9a4e9`; Lean 4.30.0, Mathlib `c5ea00351c28e24afc9f0f84379aa41082b1188f`, PNT+ `4ecb950126c4290293c5662dfe0e884123171df5`. Frozen source and dependency revisions are unchanged. No external Lean code was imported. ELAN_HOME was inferred from the installed Lake command. No staging, commit or push was performed by this agent.

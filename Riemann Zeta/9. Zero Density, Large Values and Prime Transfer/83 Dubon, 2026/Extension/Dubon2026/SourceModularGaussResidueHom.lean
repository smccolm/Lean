/-! DUB-17/18 -> original Frobenius/inertia -> good/place reduction ->
actual modular Gauss residue map. Choose literal integral Laurent fraction
witnesses, prove independence of that choice by cross multiplication, and
construct the coefficient-reduction ring homomorphism. Its kernel is exactly
the maximal ideal, and its restriction to constants is the original valuation.
Actual residue-image identification and good reduction are subsequent consumers.

# Authorized cardinality/energy powering repair

Authorized by the owner on 20 September 2026. This replaces the false
supporting requirement in EPZAE-34, not any advertised final theorem.
The printed Lemma 62 and its kernel-checked counterexample are preserved.

## Corrected statement

Let `E₄(σ,τ,ρ,e)` mean `∃ s, E(σ,τ,ρ,e,s)`, using the existing, faithfully
defined five-dimensional energy region. For each fixed positive **integer**
`k` and each point `E₄(σ,τ,ρ,e)`, prove both:

```text
∃ eCard, E₄(σ, τ/k, ρ/k, eCard) ∧ eCard ≤ e/k;
∃ rEnergy, E₄(σ, τ/k, rEnergy, e/k) ∧ rEnergy ≤ ρ/k.
```

The two points may be different. Expanded into five coordinates, their last
coordinates are independent existential values `sCard` and `sEnergy`.
Neither is compared with the original `s`, with `s/k`, or with each other.
There is no third witness preserving the double-zeta exponent. The domain
`1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1`, `τ,ρ,e ≥ 0` is retained through region membership.
The integer-power domain makes explicit the polynomial expansion used in
the source proof.

`EnergyPowering.lean` defines this exact target as
`CorrectedCardinalityEnergyPowering`. **A definition of this proposition is
not its proof. The general analytic existence theorem remains open.**

## Mathematical repair argument

Start with a realizing sequence of actual large-value patterns. The fixed
power `k` is chosen before the sequence and all limiting arguments.

1. If reusing the local half-open polynomial API, remove the single left
   endpoint of `[N,2N]`. Its contribution has norm at most one. Since
   `V = N^(σ+o(1))` and `σ ≥ 1/2`, this replaces `V` by `V-1` without changing
   its exponent. This needs an explicit Lean bridge, not an endpoint omission.
2. Expand the `k`th power. The product coefficients have a bound
   `C(k,η) m^η` uniform in the original scale and coefficients. Subdivide
   `(N^k,2^k N^k]` into `k` dyadic blocks. Assign each ordinate to a block
   where the powered polynomial has modulus at least `V^k/k`, with the
   endpoint adjustment above when applicable.
3. Normalize coefficients to be one-bounded. Choose `η→0` and the original
   scale large enough to absorb `C(k,η)` before extracting a sequence.
   Each output scale has `M = N^(k+o(1))`, height exponent `τ/k`, and value
   exponent `σ`. Embed half-open blocks into the closed-support pattern
   definition by putting zero at the left endpoint.
4. Ordinary pigeonholing selects a class with cardinality at least `|W|/k`.
   Its energy is at most the original energy. A separate energy selection
   selects a class with energy at least `E₁(W)/(9 k^4)` and cardinality at
   most `|W|`. Constants depending on fixed `k` disappear in the exponents.
5. Extract convergent logarithmic coordinates along a subsequence for each
   selected family. Cardinality and energy are bounded by the existing
   one-separation estimates. The **new** double-zeta exponent can also be
   extracted using `|W'| M² ≲ S(M,W') ≲ |W'|² M²`; it is not inherited
   from the old scale. The two resulting subsequences give the two witnesses.

This is the mathematical proof route. Its remaining Lean obligations are
the actual powered-pattern construction, the endpoint and uniform
normalization bridges, and the two compactness consumers preserving the
specified coordinate equalities. None may be replaced by assuming the
desired witnesses.

Existing reusable inputs include local `finite_polynomial_power_identity_Ioc`,
`finitePowCoeff_bound_uniform`, and `exists_energy_color_classes`, together
with the target's energy logarithmic-coordinate compactness machinery.

## Why the Heath–Brown step survives

Write the exact displayed right side as `H(σ,τ,ρ,e)`. It has no `s`
argument and is nondecreasing in `ρ` for fixed `σ,τ,e`. Applying the
analytic relation to the energy-preserving output gives

```text
e/k ≤ H(σ, τ/k, rEnergy, e/k) ≤ H(σ, τ/k, ρ/k, e/k).
```

Likewise the cardinality-preserving output transfers bounds on `ρ/k`.
The explicit use of Lemma 62 in the paper's proof of `Add-est` (i) records
an `s'≤s/k` condition but never uses it in the following Heath–Brown
deduction. Removing that unused condition repairs this particular logical
step. See the [pinned paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.16779v1).

The Lean module proves the finite energy-class selection, the separate
monotone-constraint consumers, and the Heath–Brown consumer. The latter is
**conditional** on the corrected witnesses and the separately stated
analytic Heath–Brown relation. It is not a proof of either input.
Identity-power and singleton regressions check that the repair retains the
original region semantics; the singleton's new `s` is still `2`.

## Optimization boundary

Inspection of the pinned paper-time archive `9953003` found:

- `additive_energy.py:get_raise_to_power_hypothesis` scales all five
  coordinates using `[1,k,k,k,k]`. Keep this as historical source, not as
  a trusted rule for the repaired proof.
- `literature.py:add_lver_heath_brown_1979b1` represents the displayed
  relation by nine affine alternatives. Each has zero coefficient on `s`.
- `additive_energy.py:lv_to_lver` lifts large-value estimates without a
  mathematical `s` constraint, but adds finite computational boxes.
- The inspected `derived.py:prove_zero_density_energy_2` through `_10`
  use the Heath–Brown `2a` relation and large-value estimates as their
  analytic inputs. This supports an `s`-free repair route; it is not an
  exact replay or Lean certification of their endpoint outputs.

The repaired finite proof must work with the four-coordinate projection
and individually justified monotone inequalities. **An arbitrary `s`-free
polytope is not automatically preserved by two separate witnesses.**
Conditional consumers in Lean state the needed monotonicity explicitly.
Discard the fifth-coordinate computational boxes when projecting, and
justify the remaining finite boxes on the actual parameter ranges.
Never scale an `s`-dependent constraint using the disproved rule.

Every one of the nine `Add-est` clauses still needs its exact rational
certificate, interval/endpoints, analytic inputs, and zero-energy assembly
checked. The public bounds are unchanged; their recovery by this repaired
route remains an obligation, not a conclusion of the static source inspection.

## Acceptance and preservation

EPZAE-34 is complete only when `CorrectedCardinalityEnergyPowering` has a
kernel-checked proof on its full domain and both actual witnesses are
available to the downstream consumers. EPZAE-35/36/37 remain separate
analytic-relation, optimization, and final-estimate obligations.
The architecture and goal now follow that route; authorization is no longer
a blocker.

Keep `EnergyPoweringObstruction.lean`, its explicit axiom audits, and its
semantic regressions in the default import graph and in
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` coverage. Its preserved source SHA-256 is
`76301acb24e912c76557d9b02dce8a3f50cbb2c953d5578743a069d70949a487`.
The source archives, source-hash ledger, definitions of `S` and `E`, and all
advertised final theorem statements are unchanged.

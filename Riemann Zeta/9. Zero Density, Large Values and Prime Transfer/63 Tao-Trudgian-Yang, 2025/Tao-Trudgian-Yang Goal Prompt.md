# Whole-proof operational goal prompt

## Objective

Produce a reproducible, kernel-checked Lean 4 formalization of every new
mathematical output in Tao--Trudgian--Yang, arXiv `2501.16779v1`, while reusing
the live ANTEDB Lean foundations and the completed local Guth--Maynard
formalization where their exact interfaces agree.

The work is complete only when the source statements, Lean statements,
dependency graph, audit, documentation, and build runner agree. Python
optimization, numerical checks, and prose derivations may generate
certificates, but they may not serve as proof oracles.

## Frozen public theorem contract

Authorized supporting-lemma correction (20 September 2026): preserve the
kernel-checked counterexample to printed `power-energy` (Lemma 62), and
replace EPZAE-34 with the cardinality/energy two-witness theorem specified
below and in `Tao-Trudgian-Yang Energy Powering Repair.md`. Drop the false
`s' ≤ s/k` restrictions and the third, `s`-preserving witness. This is an
explicit correction to a supporting lemma, not to the advertised outputs.
Keep the original paper, the definitions of `S` and `E`, and the
counterexample unchanged. All public theorem statements below remain frozen.

The release layer must expose source-facing theorems for the following labels.

### Exponent-pair output

`new-exp-pair` must prove that each of the following is an exponent pair:

```text
(89/1282, 997/1282)
(652397/9713986, 7599781/9713986)
(10769/351096, 609317/702192)
(89/3478, 15327/17390)
```

The predicate must unfold to the paper's analytic exponential-sum estimate;
membership in a finite list or a convex polygon is not by itself the intended
claim.

### Zero-density outputs

With `A(sigma)` interpreted through the paper's zero-count convention and
epsilon-loss asymptotics, prove:

1. `hb-density2`:
   `A(sigma) <= 3 / (10*sigma - 7)` for `7/10 < sigma <= 1`.
2. `bourgain-density-improved`:
   `A(sigma) <= max (2/(9*sigma-6)) (9/(8*(2*sigma-1)))`
   for `17/22 <= sigma <= 4/5`, with the two stated subranges certified.
3. `bourgain-zero-density-optimized`: the exact eight-piece rational bound
   recorded in the crosswalk for `3/4 < sigma < 1`.

The final theorem chain must consume actual zeta zeros with multiplicity and
must prove the bridge from the local project's rectangle convention to the
paper's `Re rho >= sigma`, `|Im rho| <= T` convention.

### Additive-energy output

`Add-est` must prove all nine source clauses for
`A*(sigma) * (1-sigma)`, over their exact closed intervals and with the exact
maxima of rational functions shown in the paper. Additive energy must count
the intended approximate additive relations at unit tolerance, including
multiplicity and the paper's epsilon-loss normalization.

## Supporting source results in scope

The release outputs require faithful formal versions of:

- cheap asymptotic notation and automatic uniformity;
- model phase functions and `beta(alpha)`;
- exponent pairs, their convexity, A/B/C processes, the Sargos D-process, and
  beta/exponent-pair duality;
- the Heath--Brown derivative bound and all beta-table segments actually used
  by the four new pairs;
- zeta growth and the exponent-pair-to-`mu` bridge;
- large-value patterns, `LV`, zeta large values `LV_zeta`, subdivision,
  powering, and the cited classical/Guth--Maynard/Bourgain estimates;
- zero-density exponents and the Type I/Type II transfer from large values;
- the Bourgain zero-density theorem and its admissibility side conditions;
- additive energy, `LV*`, `LV*_zeta`, the five-dimensional energy regions,
  the corrected cardinality/energy powering theorem, and the Heath--Brown
  relation; and
- exact rational/polyhedral optimization certificates for every final
  envelope and interval split.

An upstream theorem may be imported only after its quantifiers, interval
conventions, coefficient normalization, sign convention, epsilon losses, and
constant dependencies are matched by a proved bridge.

### Corrected EPZAE-34 contract

Define `E₄(σ,τ,ρ,e) := ∃ s, E(σ,τ,ρ,e,s)`. For every fixed integer
`k ≥ 1` and every `E₄(σ,τ,ρ,e)`, prove:

```text
∃ eCard, E₄(σ, τ/k, ρ/k, eCard) ∧ eCard ≤ e/k;
∃ rEnergy, E₄(σ, τ/k, rEnergy, e/k) ∧ rEnergy ≤ ρ/k.
```

These are two potentially different witnesses. Their existential fifth
coordinates have no asserted relation to the input `s` or to `s/k`.
The full Lean target is `CorrectedCardinalityEnergyPowering`, now proved by
`correctedCardinalityEnergyPowering` in `CorrectedEnergyPowering.lean`.
Maintain that complete proof from actual powered Dirichlet polynomials,
uniform coefficient normalization, finite cardinality/energy selection,
and coordinate-preserving subsequence limits. The target's proposition
definition alone is not proof evidence; neither witness may be assumed.

Use the cardinality witness for large-value constraints and the energy
witness for the Heath--Brown relation, whose right side is nondecreasing
in cardinality and independent of `s`. Feed those justified constraints
into exact energy optimization and the nine unchanged `Add-est` clauses.

EPZAE-35 is now proved by `InLargeValueEnergyRegion.heathBrown_relation`;
`InCardinalityEnergyRegion.heathBrown_powered` composes the two proved
inputs without a separate analytic hypothesis. Maintain its exact source
signature and full `τ ≥ 0` domain. The finite derivation uses the native
second and fourth moments, with proved reflection, support, energy-count,
constant-dependency, and height-padding bridges. It does not use the
mismatched `N` factor in the archived `hbt` proof. The small-height
three-branch constraint and its powered consumer are available for EPZAE-36;
their existence does not complete any final projection or `Add-est` clause.
Keep these modules, their explicit audits and semantic regressions covered
by `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`, updating its PowerShell inventory and
the root imports whenever this proof chain changes.
Do not infer arbitrary polytope closure or use any scaled `s` constraint.
Keep `energyPowering_source_counterexample` as a permanent audited regression.

The clause-(i) general intermediate `imphb-lver-ineq` is now proved by
`InLargeValueEnergyRegion.energyClauseOneGeneral_lower_piece` and
`InLargeValueEnergyRegion.energyClauseOneGeneral_upper_piece`, with exact
range `[8σ-4,2(8σ-4)]`, closed crossover `σ=4/5`, and full upper endpoint
`σ=5/6`. `energyClauseOneGeneral_uniform_bound` and
`energyClauseOneGeneral_high_height_bound` supply uniform general bounds.
Maintain their actual dependency on corrected cardinality witnesses at
`k,k+1` and the separate corrected energy witness. The Huxley energy-region
bridge is proved in `ClassicalLargeValueRegions`; the six-branch rational
certificate is in `EnergyClauseOneGeneral`. Do not infer arbitrary region
closure from these specific, proved deductions.

`energyClauseOne_of_zeta_range` retains the real zeta-energy bounds
on `[1,8σ-4)` as its modular inputs. The continuation below now derives
that complete range from the dyadic twelfth moment. Prove the moment
before claiming `Add-est (i)`; the independent source endpoint-two
reduction remains part of EPZAE-33.
The other eight final clauses remain in scope. Keep both new modules and
their endpoint/consumer regressions in `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`
coverage, updating the root imports, explicit audit, and runner inventory.

The clause-(i) zeta rational certificate is now proved in
`EnergyClauseOneZeta`: six affine branches, the exact `τ=4σ-1` height
transition, `σ=65/86` crossover, and domination by the advertised maximum.
Preserve its distinction from the analytic estimate. The actual-region
consumer derives its Huxley cap from corrected cardinality powering and
its Heath--Brown relation from the proved native analytic chain; it still
requires the independent twelfth-moment cardinality inequality.
`InZetaLargeValueEnergyRegion.rho_le_of_largeValueBound` proves the exact
uniform-LV-to-region bridge, and the resulting uniform zeta-energy bounds
remain conditional on `IsZetaLargeValueBound σ τ (2τ-12(σ-1/2))`.

`energyClauseOne_of_twelfth_and_short_zeta` now gives end-to-end assembly
with precisely the modular short zeta-energy input on `[1,2)` and the
twelfth-moment LV input on `[2,8σ-4)`. The latter now follows from the
dyadic critical-line moment through `ZetaTwelfthFromMoment` below.
The short-zeta continuation below supplies the former from the same
moment, so only that moment remains in the assembled clause-(i) signature.
Prove it before claiming clause (i). The nearby Gafni--Tao `HeathBrownTwelfthStatement`
file contains a proposition and conditional consumers, not an importable
proof of the full twelfth-moment estimate. Do not treat it as an axiom or
completed analytic input. Keep `EnergyClauseOneZeta`, all named audits,
closed-endpoint regressions, and conditional signatures in
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` coverage.

The critical-line, twelfth-power summation step of `add-bound (ii)` is now
proved in `ZetaMomentKernel` and `ZetaMomentTransfer` on the actual zeta
function and the source interval `[T/2,3T]`. `ZetaMomentAsymptotics` proves
logarithmic-loss absorption and dyadic/source-window normalization, with
a consumer on actual `ZetaLargeValuePattern` objects. Preserve the exact
physical `C^12 N^6` normalization and uniform height threshold.
The low-level finite consumer explicitly assumes pointwise entry and the
dyadic critical-line moment separately. Preserve that modular interface;
`ZetaPerronEntry` now discharges the pointwise premise and
`ZetaTwelfthFromMoment` proves the uniform epsilon--delta LV deduction.
The moment hypothesis itself remains open. A conditional deduction does
not discharge `twelfth-bound`.
Do not assume away a Perron residue, smoothing loss, or support endpoint.
Keep all three modules, their 21 named public audits, and ten semantic
regressions in the root imports and `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`
inventory; update the runner whenever this analytic chain changes.

The exact coefficient-one source identity is now proved in
`ZetaIntervalCutoff`, `ZetaMellinEntry`, `ZetaMellinContour`, and
`ZetaMellinShift`. Preserve the actual-pattern consumer
`ZetaLargeValuePattern.polynomial_eq_critical_zeta_mellin`: the original
sharp polynomial equals the whole critical-line zeta integral plus
`mellin cutoff (1-it)`. The cutoff equals the active indicator at every
integer; both endpoints, the negative phase, and the moving pole are exact.
The native smooth-test object is constructed from this cutoff. Boundary
integrability, horizontal decay, and the contour shift are proved, with
constants permitted to depend on the fixed cutoff and ordinate.

Quantitative Mellin bounds, source-window localization, and residue/tail
absorption are now proved in the six-module continuation below. Preserve
their actual dependencies; do not replace them by fixed-cutoff convergence
or an independently assumed entry estimate. Keep these four identity
modules, their
36 named public theorem audits, the explicit cutoff-constructor audit, and
ten semantic regressions in the root imports and
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` inventory. Update and rerun that principal
runner whenever the analytic chain, audit, or production coverage changes.
The preserved Lemma 62 counterexample and all final publication contracts
remain unchanged.

The uniform continuation consists of `ZetaCutoffDerivatives`,
`ZetaMellinDerivative`, `ZetaMellinUniform`, `ZetaMellinLocalization`,
`ZetaPerronEntry`, and `ZetaTwelfthFromMoment`. For `j ≥ 1`,
the cutoff derivative integral is bounded independently of its endpoints,
and for `σ ≥ 1/2` the Mellin estimate is
`|M_w(σ+iu)| ≤ C_j(σ) N^(σ+j-1)/(1+|u|)^j`.
The omitted critical integral is at most
`120 C_4(1/2) N^(7/2)/T²`; the residue is at most
`C_4(1) N^4/(1+|t|)^4`. The actual-pattern `perron_entry` absorbs both
when `T ≥ N^(7/4)` and `V ≥ 2 zetaPerronError`.
`exists_zetaPerron_uniform_threshold` derives these physical conditions
from the source windows, uniformly for `σ ≥ 1/2`, `τ ≥ 2`, `δ ≤ 1/4`.

`zetaTwelfth_largeValueBound_of_dyadic` proves the full uniform
`IsZetaLargeValueBound σ τ (2τ-12(σ-1/2))` from the genuine dyadic
critical-line twelfth moment alone. Its constants and approximation
radius precede the actual pattern. No pointwise entry or cardinality
conclusion is an assumed input.
`energyClauseOne_of_dyadic_moment_and_short_zeta` composes this theorem
with corrected powering, Heath--Brown energy, and the exact optimizations.
Its two-input signature is preserved as a modular consumer. The short-zeta
continuation below supplies its energy premise from the same dyadic moment.
Prove that moment; do not reintroduce the discharged short-zeta premise.
Other source moment parameters, other eight energy clauses, and the
complete EPZAE-00--41 contract remain in scope.

Keep all six continuation modules, their 39 named public theorem audits,
the constructed derivative-test audit, and 14 regressions in root imports
and `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` coverage. Update and rerun that
runner as this chain changes. Neither a passing runner nor a conditional
moment consequence proves the missing moment or any final `Add-est` clause.

### Short-zeta completion and remaining clause-(i) obligation

`ZetaShortPerron` proves threshold-relative entry for actual patterns:
`T ≥ N^(23/16)` and `V ≥ 2 zetaPerronError N^(5/8)` suffice. Its uniform
threshold derives these from `σ ≥ 3/4`, `τ ≥ 3/2`, `δ ≤ 1/16` source
windows. `zetaTwelfth_short_largeValueBound_of_dyadic` consumes this
entry and gives the exact same twelfth-moment cardinality exponent.

`ZetaShortPatterns` preserves the full closed sharp interval, including
its left endpoint, and proves
`|polynomial(t)| ≤ 2 + 200 sqrt(t) + 12 pi N/t` for `1 ≤ t ≤ N²`.
The bound uses the native first/second derivative estimates on actual
prefixes, not an assumed cancellation hypothesis. Its uniform consumer
proves eventual emptiness for `σ ≥ 3/4`, `1 ≤ τ < 3/2`, hence
`zetaShort_largeValueExponent_eq_bot` and every candidate energy bound.

`energyClauseOne_short_cubic_bound` certifies
`3(2τ-12(σ-1/2)) ≤ energyClauseOnePublicRate(σ) τ` for `σ ≥ 3/4`,
`0 ≤ τ ≤ 2`. The actual short-zeta consumer combines this with cubic
energy and the two height ranges. `energyClauseOne_of_dyadic_moment`
then proves the exact zero-energy bound throughout `3/4 ≤ σ ≤ 5/6`,
conditional only on the explicitly quantified genuine dyadic twelfth
moment. No short-zeta, cardinality, energy, or density conclusion is a
theorem parameter. It uses the proved endpoint-one transfer; it does not
silently replace that endpoint with two.

Maintain `ZetaShortPerron`, `ZetaShortPatterns`,
`EnergyClauseOneFromMoment`, their original 11 public theorems, and the new
short-height LV theorem in `ZetaTwelfthFromMoment`: 12 new named audits
and eight boundary/consumer regressions. Keep all of them in the root
imports and `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` inventory; update and rerun
the runner whenever this chain changes. Preserve the counterexample and
all public contracts. The actual twelfth moment is the next missing
analytic input for clause (i). The general endpoint-two source theorem,
other eight energy clauses, and full EPZAE-00--41 scope remain required.

### Zeta discreteness and the remaining moment route

Preserve `ZetaLargeValueDiscreteness`, `ZetaPointwiseNonexistence`, and
`zetaShort_pointwise_powerSaving`: 13 additional named public theorem
audits and eight semantic regressions. The exact infimum/uniform-bound
equivalence, negative-exponent collapse, and positive-height pointwise
power-saving equivalence are proved for actual sharp-interval patterns.
Their singleton construction is genuine; the reverse direction absorbs
the `[T,2T]` factor two by shrinking the radius and enlarging the threshold.
Keep both modules in the root imports and the inventory behind
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`; update and rerun that batch entry point
and the foundation runner after changes.

The online ANTEDB Lemma 8.11 uses a maximum. Theorem 9.7's displayed proof
switches it to a minimum without justification. Use the proved
`zetaLargeValueExponent_le_double_of_le_max`: for `a ≥ 0` the maximum
is `2a`; for `a < 0`, actual cardinality discreteness gives negative
infinity. This algebraic step does not prove Ivić's analytic estimate.
The pinned Ivić scan gives the underlying route in Theorem 7.1,
Corollary 7.2, and the local mean-square Theorem 6.2. Its title pages
identify *Topics in Recent Zeta Function Theory*, Orsay report 83.06,
not the book edition cited by ANTEDB. The sharp local mean-square
inequality, subsequent scale/spacing assembly, and the actual dyadic
twelfth moment still need proofs. The exact divisor-series entry is
proved in the continuation below. Do not import the nearby Gafni--Tao proposition as an
instance or regard its Atkinson Gram estimate as the missing zeta entry.
The preserved powering counterexample, final source contracts, and full
EPZAE-00--41 goal are unchanged.

### Exact local mean-square source entry

Preserve the six proved modules `ZetaSquareContour`,
`ZetaSquareContourShift`, `ZetaSquareDivisorKernel`,
`ZetaSquareDivisorSeries`, `ZetaSquareSourceEntry`, and
`ZetaSquareLocalMean`. The first two adapt the adjacent one-sided
contour proof to canonical native imports, not the separate Gafni--Tao
package. The complete right-line expansion uses the actual coefficients
`n.divisors.card`, proves every term integrable and the integrated norms
summable, and identifies both reflected contours by their limits.

`hasSum_zetaSquareNormalizedContribution` removes the Gamma normalization
and gives the actual critical-line squared norm, including height zero.
`hasSum_zetaSquareLocalMean` proves the complete coefficientwise local
integrals sum to `∫[a,b] |ζ(1/2+it)|²`, for every `a ≤ b`.
It derives compact-height domination and continuity before interchanging
the sum and integral. No local mean-square or moment theorem is assumed.

This identity does not discharge Ivić's uniform Theorem 6.2. The
averaging continuation below is now proved; continue through the
proved uniform shifted-Gamma/complete-series bridge and source-scale
finite shortening and smooth Voronoi/Bessel entry to the remaining
stationary-phase reduction, with physical parameter ranges, sharp tail and remainder
bounds, and scale/spacing assembly, to the genuine dyadic twelfth moment.
The Gaussian convergence majorant and compact-dependent constants are
not the required uniform Atkinson estimate. Keep EPZAE-21/37 open until
the advertised analytic and final energy conclusions actually follow.

Maintain all six modules, their 47 named public theorem audits, and nine
source-entry regressions in the root imports and the inventory behind
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`. Update and rerun that batch entry point
and the foundation runner whenever the chain changes. Preserve the
counterexample and both corrected witnesses; no source pin, fifth-coordinate
restriction, public output, or full EPZAE-00--41 obligation is changed.

### Uniform Gaussian averaging and the remaining phase bridge

Preserve `ZetaSquareAveraging`, `ZetaSquareGaussianTail`, and
`ZetaSquareGaussianTransform`, their 31 named public theorem audits,
and nine regressions. Weighted divisor-series convergence is proved
for continuous real weights. The local Gaussian majorization uses
`exp(1)` independently of `T,G,L`. Centering preserves the exact
Jacobian `G`, and the whole-line actual-zeta integral is integrable.
One constant controls the tail by
`C G(1+|T|+G)² exp(-L²/2)`. On the source logarithmic window, for
every real `A`, one threshold works for all `0<G≤T` and gives
`G T^(-A)`. `exists_zetaSquareGaussian_source_approximation` consumes
both the weighted divisor identity and the actual tail, with no
moment or source-entry premise.

The quadratic coefficient is exactly `G^(-2)+i/(2T)`. The transform
and its frequency estimate `sqrt(pi) G exp(-(Gv)²/8)` are proved for
`T,G>0` and `G²≤2T`, including the closed boundary and both frequency
signs. The actual unit-phase approximation and integrated error are
proved below. The following amplitude continuation also proves a uniform
complete reflected-source remainder. The shortened divisor sum is not
proved by either the phase-only transform or that remainder;
continue through Voronoi/stationary phase, uniform remainders, physical
scale/spacing assembly, and the actual dyadic twelfth moment.
EPZAE-21/37 and all final public outputs remain open.

Keep all three modules in the root imports and the inventory behind
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`; update and rerun that exact entry
point and the foundation runner when the analytic chain changes.
The original counterexample, corrected two-witness powering, proved
Heath--Brown energy relation, source pins, and full EPZAE-00--41
contract remain unchanged.

### Actual Gamma phase and the amplitude continuation

Preserve `ZetaDigammaLog`, `ZetaSquareGammaPhase`,
`ZetaSquareGammaQuadratic`, and `ZetaSquareGammaTransform`, their 26
named public theorem audits, and 12 regressions. The actual digamma
series proves `‖psi(z)-log(z)‖≤4/|Im z|` for `Re z>0`, `|Im z|≥1`.
No Stirling or phase-asymptotic theorem is assumed.

The reflected phase is exactly
`phi(t)=GammaR(1/2-it)/GammaR(1/2+it)`. Preserve its unit norm, actual
zeta functional-equation consumer, exact Gamma-normalization factorization,
and real-frequency differential equation. Its frequency differs from
`-log(t/(2pi))` by at most `9/t` for `t≥2`. On the closed window
`|x|≤r≤T/2`, `T≥4`, the phase differs from
`phi(T) exp(-i[x log(T/(2pi))+x²/(2T)])` by at most
`(18/T+2r²/T²)|x|`.

`norm_zetaSquareGammaGaussianTransform_sub_quadratic_le` consumes the
finite integrated comparison and both Gaussian tails. For `G>0`, its
error is `2r²(18/T+2r²/T²)+2sqrt(2pi)G exp(-(r/G)²/2)`, uniformly in
the real frequency `v`. The following norm-bound consumer uses the
proved quadratic damping at frequency `v-log(T/(2pi))`, on `G²≤2T`.

The actual source contains
`[GammaR(1/2-it+w)/GammaR(1/2-it)]²`, the pole-removal factors, and
the contour/divisor weights. Their uniform kernel approximation and
complete reflected-series remainder are proved in the continuation below.
Weight bounds, height variation, the complete quadratic Gaussian
comparison and source-scale shortening are proved in the subsequent
continuations, as is the actual smooth Voronoi/Bessel entry. Continue
through uniform stationary phase and the sharp Atkinson inequality
to the dyadic twelfth moment.
Do not replace those amplitudes by `1` or call the unit-phase transform
an unconditional local zeta mean-square theorem. EPZAE-21/37 remain open.

Keep all four modules in root imports and in the inventory behind
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`; update and rerun that exact batch
entry point and the foundation runner whenever the chain changes.
Preserve the original counterexample, corrected two witnesses,
Heath--Brown energy theorem, all source pins and public outputs, and
the entire EPZAE-00--41 goal.


### Uniform shifted amplitude and complete reflected source

Preserve the seven modules `ZetaGammaShiftLog`, `ZetaGammaShiftAmplitude`,
`ZetaSquarePoleShift`, `ZetaSquareNearKernel`, `ZetaSquareGammaInverse`,
`ZetaSquareKernelApproximation`, and `ZetaSquareLeadingDivisor`.
They add 44 public theorem audits; the promoted actual Gamma derivative
`hasDerivAt_gammaReal` adds one further named audit. Fourteen new
regressions retain zero shift/height/coefficient, both contour signs,
closed shift and central-contour boundaries, and the uniform source consumer.

For `t≥4`, `Re w≥0`, `‖w‖≤t/2`, put
`ell(t)=log(t/(2pi))-i*pi/2` and `B=(17‖w‖+2‖w‖²)/t`.
The literal squared Gamma ratio, normalized by `exp(-w ell)`,
differs from one by at most `B exp(B)`. This follows from the actual
digamma series, principal-branch path geometry, the exact derivative,
and Gronwall. The actual squared pole factor is bounded by 9 and
differs from one by at most `12‖w‖/t`.

`exists_norm_zetaSquareRightKernel_sub_leading_le` combines the near
estimate with the far inverse-Gamma/reflection estimate. One constant,
independent of `t≥4`, bounds the complete normalized reflected kernel
error by `C exp(-90u²)(1+|u|)^12`. The majorant is integrable.
`hasSum_zetaSquareLeadingDivisorContribution` proves convergence of
the full leading ordinary-divisor series.
`exists_norm_zetaSquareDivisorIntegral_sub_leading_le` consumes that
series and the actual source integral to give one uniform `O(1)`
remainder, with no analytic theorem premise.

This closes the amplitude/complete reflected-series remainder. The
following continuation proves actual weight control, height variation,
freezing and the local Gaussian-window comparison with a complete
quadratic divisor sum. The later continuation also proves source-scale
finite shortening and the actual smooth Voronoi/Bessel entry. Uniform
stationary phase,
sharp Atkinson errors, scale/spacing assembly and genuine dyadic twelfth
moment remain open. Do not substitute a full-series absolute bound
for the needed oscillatory estimate. EPZAE-21/37 and final outputs stay open.

Keep all seven modules, all 45 newly named audits and the regressions
in root imports and in the inventory behind
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`. Update and rerun that exact batch
entry point and the foundation runner whenever this chain changes.
The original counterexample, independent corrected fifth coordinates,
proved powering/Heath--Brown results, source pins, and full
EPZAE-00--41 goal remain unchanged.

### Actual divisor weights, freezing and Gaussian source assembly

Nine further modules are preserved: `ZetaDivisorWeightKernel`,
`ZetaDivisorWeightReflection`, `ZetaDivisorWeightSource`,
`ZetaDivisorWeightVariation`, `ZetaDivisorWeightMass`,
`ZetaDivisorWeightFreezing`, `ZetaFrozenDivisorGaussian`,
`ZetaSquareRealSource`, and `ZetaSquareFrozenWindow`.
They add 78 named public theorem audits and 20 semantic regressions.

The actual Mellin weight `W(q)` satisfies `W(q)+W(-q)=1` and
`W(0)=1/2`, proved by its contour residue and integrable tails.
On each fixed imaginary strip, `‖W(q)‖≤C min(1,exp(-Re q))`.
The actual divisor argument is
`q(T,n)=log n-log(T/(2pi))+i*pi/2`, not a real cutoff.
For `T>0`, `n>0` and `|x|≤T/2`, its weight variation is at most
`C (|x|/T) min(T/(2pi n),2pi n/T)`.
The coefficient mass is `Oε(T^(1/2+ε))`, uniformly in the
oscillatory height; it is derived from the convergent divisor L-series,
not a postulated pointwise divisor estimate.

`exists_norm_zetaSquareLeadingDivisor_sub_frozen_le` freezes only
this weight, with error `Cε |x| T^(-1/2+ε)` on `T≥8`, `|x|≤T/2`.
The phase and Dirichlet oscillation remain at `T+x`.
`zetaSquareNorm_eq_reflected_source` proves the conjugate pairing
and the factor two for the actual real zeta square, including height zero.
`exists_abs_zetaSquareNorm_sub_frozen_le` consumes the actual
normalized contour remainder and this pairing.

`hasSum_zetaFrozenDivisorGaussianMean` proves the complete Gaussian
series exchange after absolute integrated-norm summability.
Write `M(T)=Σ_n ‖zetaFrozenDivisorCoefficient T n‖`, and let `Q(T,G)`
be the defined convergent quadratic divisor sum, retaining its exact
complex weight and actual central phase. The public consumer
`exists_abs_zetaSquareGaussianWindow_sub_quadratic_le` proves
for `T≥8`, `G>0`, `G²≤2T`, `0≤r≤T/2`:

```text
| actual Gaussian zeta window on T±r - 2 Re Q(T,G) |
 ≤ Cε r (1 + r T^(-1/2+ε))
   + M(T) [4r²(18/T+2r²/T²) + 6sqrt(2pi)G exp(-(r/G)²/2)].
```

This theorem consumes the real zeta source, frozen weights, actual
Gamma-phase transform, and both Gaussian tails. It has no analytic
theorem premise. It is a complete-series comparison, not the shortened
Ivić/Atkinson sum or the genuine twelfth moment.

The following continuation combines the proved whole-line zeta tail,
uniform logarithmic window and frequency shortening into the actual
local-mean-square entry to a finite divisor source; the continuation
also proves smooth Voronoi/Bessel entry. Uniform stationary estimates,
the Atkinson inequality and
dyadic moment remain open, as does the analytic input to
`energyClauseOne_of_dyadic_moment`. All nine unconditional `Add-est`
clauses and other public outputs remain required by the full
EPZAE-00--41 goal; no continuation narrows that goal.

Keep all nine modules in root imports, all 78 public audits and all
20 regressions in the inventory behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`.
Update that exact batch interface's backing inventory whenever the chain
changes, and rerun it and `run_lake_build.bat`; do not bypass their gates.
The original Lemma 62 counterexample, corrected independent fifth
coordinates, powering/Heath--Brown proofs and pinned sources are unchanged.

### Finite divisor shortening and the source-scale local mean

Preserve six further modules: `ZetaQuadraticDivisorBand`,
`ZetaQuadraticDivisorShortening`, `ZetaSourceLogScales`,
`ZetaSourceErrorScales`, `ZetaShortDivisorSource`, and
`ZetaShortDivisorGeometry`. Their 29 public theorems have named
dependency audits and 18 additional semantic regressions.

The band is a literal finite set of positive integers, with exact
closed membership condition
`G abs(log n-log(T/(2pi)))≤L`.
The upper index bound is proved, not a separate truncation premise.
The finite sum `S(T,G,L)=zetaShortQuadraticDivisorSum T G L`
retains the actual complex Mellin weight, divisor coefficient, central
Gamma phase and quadratic Gaussian transform.
`norm_zetaFrozenDivisorQuadraticSum_sub_short_le` bounds the omitted
sum by `M(T) sqrt(pi) G exp(-L²/8)`.
For every real `A`, one threshold before all widths makes the
`L=log T` tail at most `G T^(-A)`.

For each `δ>0`, one height threshold covers every
`0<G≤T^(1/2-δ)`. The half-height window, `G²≤2T` and `G≤T`
are derived from these scales. The mass loss is chosen as `δ/4`;
the actual freezing and phase errors are then `Oδ(G log T)`.
The source consumers prove

```text
| integral_R exp(-((t-T)/G)^2) |zeta(1/2+it)|^2 dt
    - 2 Re S(T,G,log T) | ≤ Cδ G log T,

integral_[T-G,T+G] |zeta(1/2+it)|^2 dt
 ≤ 2 exp(1) Re S(T,G,log T) + Cδ G log T.
```

These are `exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_short_approximation`
and `exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_short_divisor`, with one constant
and one threshold depending only on `δ`. No moment, Voronoi,
stationary-phase or result-shaped theorem premise is present.

On the lower source scale `T^δ≤G`, the actual band satisfies
`abs(n-T/(2pi))≤T log T/(pi G)` and
`T/(4pi)≤n≤T/pi`, uniformly beyond one threshold.
`zetaShortQuadraticDivisorSum_eq_divisor_test` identifies the
literal finite sum with `Σ d(n) zetaShortDivisorTestFunction(T,G,n)`.
This exact real-variable test function retains its complex weight.

The following continuation constructs a smooth positive-support cutoff
of this actual test, pays its change from the frequency tails, and
applies native Voronoi and both literal Bessel bridges. The hard finite
band itself is not declared smooth. Uniform oscillatory estimates and
the sharp Ivić/Atkinson inequality remain required; do not assume the
source inequality or bound the entire retained oscillatory sum absolutely.

EPZAE-21/37, the genuine dyadic twelfth moment, every unconditional
`Add-est` output and the complete EPZAE-00--41 contract remains in force.
The original Lemma 62 counterexample, independent corrected fifth
coordinates and proved powering/Heath--Brown relations are unchanged.

Keep all six modules directly imported by the root, all 29 named
audits and all 18 regressions covered by
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`. Update the exact batch interface's
backing inventory as this chain changes and rerun it together with
`run_lake_build.bat`; the full goal and existing gates are not narrowed.

### Actual smooth Voronoi and literal Bessel source

Eight new modules now construct and consume the genuine smooth divisor
source: `ZetaDivisorWeightSmooth`, `ZetaDivisorTestSmooth`,
`ZetaDivisorBandCutoff`, `ZetaSmoothDivisorTest`,
`ZetaDivisorVoronoi`, `ZetaSmoothDivisorTail`,
`ZetaSquareVoronoiSource` and `ZetaDivisorBesselSource`.
They add 43 named public theorem audits and 18 semantic regressions.

The literal Mellin weight is entire in its complex logarithmic argument.
`hasDerivAt_zetaDivisorWeight` differentiates its actual contour integral
using a locally uniform integrable Gaussian majorant; real smoothness
of all orders follows from holomorphy. The evaluated Gaussian transform
and positive-axis complex power then prove smoothness of the actual
`zetaShortDivisorTestFunction` for positive arguments.

For `A=T/(2pi)`, set
`a=A exp(-2L/G)`, `b=A exp(-L/G)`,
`c=A exp(L/G)`, `d=A exp(2L/G)`. The actual cutoff is

```text
chi(x) = smoothTransition((x-a)/(b-a))
       * smoothTransition((d-x)/(d-c)),
g(T,G,L,x) = chi(x) zetaShortDivisorTestFunction(T,G,x).
```

For `T,G,L>0`, it lies in `[0,1]`, equals one throughout `[b,c]`,
and vanishes outside `[a,d]`. The closed transition endpoints are
proved. Its positive support gives global real smoothness of the
product, including at zero. `zetaSmoothDivisorVoronoiTest` constructs
the native test object; smoothness and support are not hypotheses.

`norm_zetaSmoothDivisorSum_sub_short_le` bounds the actual difference
from the earlier finite source by
`M(T) sqrt(pi) G exp(-L²/8)`, where
`M(T)=Σ norm(zetaFrozenDivisorCoefficient T n)`.
For `L=log T`, this is at most `G T^(-B)` for every fixed real
`B`, beyond one threshold uniform in all positive widths with
`G²≤2T`. Thus every smooth transition term has a proved cost.

The modulus-one native Voronoi theorem is now applied to this object,
not to an independently supplied test. Both native transforms are
then identified with their literal Bessel integrals:

```text
V0 = integral_(x>0) (log x + 2 gamma) g(x) dx,
VY = sum_n d(n) (-2pi) integral_(x>0) g(x) Y0(4pi sqrt(nx)) dx,
VK = sum_n d(n) 4 integral_(x>0) g(x) K0(4pi sqrt(nx)) dx.
```

Here `Y0` and `K0` are the native classical real-integral kernels,
not uninterpreted symbols. The zero index is handled by the actual
`d(0)=0`; it is not passed to a positive-index bridge.
`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_bessel_approximation` and
`exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_bessel` prove, for every `δ>0`,
one `Cδ>0` and one `T0≥8`, uniformly for
`T≥T0` and `0<G≤T^(1/2-δ)`:

```text
| integral_R exp(-((t-T)/G)^2) |zeta(1/2+it)|^2 dt
    - 2 Re(V0+VY+VK) | ≤ Cδ G log T,

integral_[T-G,T+G] |zeta(1/2+it)|^2 dt
 ≤ 2 exp(1) Re(V0+VY+VK) + Cδ G log T.
```

This closes the actual smooth Voronoi/Bessel **entry**, not the
stationary-phase estimate or Ivić Theorem 6.2. The following continuation
proves the complete modified-Bessel branch negligible; the later
phase-adjusted continuation also bounds and removes its actual main term.
Derive the oscillatory Neumann-kernel reduction with uniform amplitudes, tails and source
scales. The sharp Atkinson inequality, physical dyadic/Gram assembly,
genuine twelfth moment, EPZAE-21/37 and every unconditional `Add-est`
output remain open. No target-shaped analytic input is assumed.

Preserve the original Lemma 62 counterexample and the corrected
independent fifth coordinates. Keep these eight modules directly
imported, all 43 public audits and 18 regressions covered by
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`, and update its backing inventory
as the chain changes. Run it and `run_lake_build.bat` after Lean
changes. Do not narrow the complete EPZAE-00--41 goal or its gates.

### Negligible complete K0 branch and actual reduced source

Seven new modules now prove and consume the complete modified-Bessel
branch estimate: `ZetaBesselK0Decay`,
`ZetaSmoothDivisorSupport`, `ZetaSmoothDivisorMass`,
`ZetaBesselK0Integral`, `ZetaBesselK0Series`,
`ZetaBesselK0Scales` and `ZetaSquareBesselMinusSource`.
All 29 public theorem audits and 16 semantic regressions are in the
root import graph and the exact batch-runner inventory.

The kernel estimate begins with the literal integral
`K0(y)=integral_(u>0) exp(-y cosh u) du`.
It proves `K0(y)≤exp(-y/2) K0(y/2)` for `y>0`, hence
`abs(K0(y))≤2exp(-y/2)` for `y≥2`. The real exponential
series then gives, for every natural `k`,

```text
abs(K0(y)) ≤ Bk/(y^2)^k,
Bk = 2 * 2^(2k) * (2k)!.
```

For `T≥16`, `G,L>0` and `8L≤G`, the full smooth
source—including both transitions—has support in `[T/16,T]`.
The exponentiated outer-band endpoints are proved first, not supplied
as a support hypothesis. Thus every positive divisor index satisfies
`(4pi sqrt(nx))^2≥Tn` on the actual support.
The genuine test has a uniform bound `norm(g(x))≤C G` and
integrated mass at most `C G T` when `G²≤2T`.
These deliberately coarse absolute bounds are used only for the
exponentially decaying branch, not as a replacement for oscillatory
cancellation in the main or Neumann terms.

The actual K0 source integrand is proved measurable and absolutely
integrable. For every `k`, its integral has bound
`Ck G T/(T^k n^k)`, uniformly before choosing `T,G,L,n`.
For `k≥2`, summation uses the genuine ordinary-divisor Dirichlet
series at `s=2`. `hasSum_zetaBesselK0SourceTerm` identifies the
complete arithmetic series with `zetaDivisorBesselPlus`; the zero
index has its actual zero divisor coefficient.

`exists_zetaDivisorBesselPlus_powerSaving` proves, for every
`δ>0` and every real `A`, one threshold `T0≥16` such that

```text
T≥T0, T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ)
  implies norm(zetaDivisorBesselPlus(T,G,log T)) ≤ G T^(-A).
```

All scale conditions, cutoff widths and constants are derived
uniformly, before choosing `G`. The lower width `G≥T^δ` is
explicit: this is the source range, not the earlier wider
Voronoi-entry range with arbitrary positive `G`.

The public source consumers
`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_main_minus_approximation`
and `exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_main_minus` use this proved
power saving, not a supplied transform-error premise. On that range,
one constant and threshold depending only on `δ` give

```text
| integral_R exp(-((t-T)/G)^2) |zeta(1/2+it)|^2 dt
    - 2 Re(V0+VY) | ≤ Cδ G log T,

integral_[T-G,T+G] |zeta(1/2+it)|^2 dt
 ≤ 2 exp(1) Re(V0+VY) + Cδ G log T.
```

Here `V0` is the unchanged logarithmic main integral and `VY`
the actual oscillatory Neumann-kernel divisor sum. The next section
reapplies Voronoi with the source-required lattice phase. The later
continuation proves the phase-adjusted main bound. Next derive the
sharp Y0 stationary reduction with uniform amplitudes, tails and
source scales. The sharp Ivić/Atkinson
inequality, physical dyadic/Gram assembly, genuine twelfth moment,
EPZAE-21/37 and every unconditional `Add-est` output remain open.
No new analytic theorem assumption is introduced.

The original Lemma 62 counterexample, corrected independent fifth
coordinates and proved powering/Heath–Brown results remain unchanged.
The full EPZAE-00--41 goal is not narrowed. Keep all seven modules,
29 named audits and 16 regressions covered by
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`; update its backing inventory
as needed and rerun it together with `run_lake_build.bat` after
Lean changes.

### Source-aligned lattice phase and exact saddle geometry

The pinned Ivić Orsay 83.06 scan, printed page 110, equation (6.36),
inserts `exp(2pi i n)=1` before applying Voronoi. Our divisor source
has the conjugate sign `x^(-1/2+iT)`, so its continuous test must
instead be multiplied by `alpha(x)=exp(-2pi i x)`.
The unadjusted identities above remain valid, but their continuous
saddle equations are different; do not use them as the source's
Atkinson stationary phase.

Six additional modules are installed: `ZetaDivisorLatticePhase`,
`ZetaAtkinsonVoronoi`, `ZetaAtkinsonK0`,
`ZetaAtkinsonReducedSource`, `ZetaAtkinsonPhase` and
`ZetaAtkinsonSaddle`. They have 40 named public theorem audits
and 22 semantic regressions.

For the actual new test `gA=alpha*g`, every natural-index value,
pointwise norm and support is proved unchanged. Its globally smooth
positive-support native test is constructed. Applying native Voronoi
again gives new logarithmic main, Y0 and K0 integrals, not equalities
between the old and new continuous integrals. The K0 pointwise
majorant transfers by unit norm; actual integrability, complete
arithmetic summability and `HasSum` are proved for the new branch.
`exists_zetaAtkinsonBesselPlus_powerSaving` gives
`norm(VK_A)≤G T^(-A)` for every fixed real `A` on
`T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ)` beyond one threshold depending only on
`δ,A`.

The actual consumers
`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_atkinson_reduced` and
`exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_atkinson_reduced` remove that
proved branch. They retain only `zetaAtkinsonVoronoiMain` and
`zetaAtkinsonBesselMinus`, with uniform error `Cδ G log T`,
the same factors `2` and `2 exp(1)`, and one constant and
threshold before all allowed widths. No analytic estimate is a
theorem parameter.

The exact source factorization keeps the cutoff, complex Mellin
weight, Gamma factor and quadratic Gaussian in
`zetaAtkinsonAmplitude`. Its carrier, after multiplication by
`exp(4pi i b sqrt(x))`, is

```text
Phi(T,b,x) = T log x - 2pi x + 4pi b sqrt(x),
A = T/(2pi), r = (b + sqrt(b^2 + 4A))/2.
For T>0 and x>0: Phi'(x)=0 iff x=r^2,
Phi''(r^2) = -pi (2r-b)/r^3 < 0.
```

These are proved for every real `b`, including zero for the main
term and both signs of `sqrt(n)` for the prospective Bessel
carriers. The main saddle is exactly `T/(2pi)`.
This is exact carrier calculus, not a proved Y0 asymptotic expansion
or a uniform stationary-phase approximation. The amplitude is still
complex and variable; its required derivative bounds may not be
silently discarded.

The following continuation proves the **phase-adjusted** main-term
estimate. The literal Y0 expansion is now proved below. Continue with uniform
amplitudes and tails, then the sharp
Atkinson inequality and physical dyadic/Gram assembly. The genuine
twelfth moment, EPZAE-21/37 and every unconditional `Add-est`
output remain open. The preserved Lemma 62 counterexample and proved
corrected independent fifth-coordinate powering/Heath–Brown chain
are unchanged. The full EPZAE-00--41 goal remains active.

Keep all six modules directly imported, all 40 named audits and
22 regressions covered, and update the backing inventory of
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` whenever this chain changes.
Both that exact batch interface and `run_lake_build.bat` remain
mandatory after Lean changes; do not replace their gates with a
focused build or narrow the goal.

### Actual logarithmic main integral bounded and removed

Nine additional modules now bound the **phase-adjusted** logarithmic
main integral and consume the bound in the actual physical zeta
source: `IntervalAmplitudeBounds`, `ZetaMainElementaryWeights`,
`ZetaMainMellinProfile`, `ZetaLogGaussianVariation`,
`ZetaQuadraticGaussianDerivative`,
`ZetaQuadraticLogGaussianVariation`, `ZetaAtkinsonMainWeight`,
`ZetaAtkinsonMainIntegral` and `ZetaAtkinsonMinusSource`.
All 38 public theorem audits and 20 semantic regressions are covered
by root imports and the exact batch-runner inventory.

The literal `IntervalC1Bound` records smoothness, the norm bound
and the integral of the norm of the actual derivative. These are
constructed for every source factor, not assumed in the final
source theorem. The two monotone cutoff transitions have uniformly
bounded variation independent of their widths. The actual complex
Mellin weight becomes a fixed smooth profile on `[1/16,1]`
after `x/T` rescaling; its contour definition is unchanged.
The square-root, logarithmic and unit Gamma factors retain their
actual values.

Differentiating the exact complex quadratic Gaussian gives its
damped derivative, not a constant majorant over the whole support.
The logarithmic Gaussian envelope has variation at most two. This
proves the uniform complex-transform variation bound
`4 sqrt(pi) G` on the full physical support, with `G²≤2T`.
Combining every factor gives one constant independent of `T,G,L`
such that the complete main amplitude has norm and variation at
most `C G sqrt(T) log T`.

The native `norm_weighted_gmReflectionIntegral_le` applies to
the exact carrier `T log x - 2pi x` and supplies
`10/sqrt(T)` cancellation. The actual main integrand is proved
absolutely integrable; the positive-support restriction and exact
reflection identity are proved. Consequently
`exists_norm_zetaAtkinsonVoronoiMain_le` gives

```text
norm(zetaAtkinsonVoronoiMain(T,G,L)) ≤ C G log T
for T≥16, log T≥1, G>0, G²≤2T, L>0 and 8L≤G.
```

The source-scale theorem derives these conditions uniformly at
`L=log T`, with a threshold before every
`T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ)`. The public consumers
`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_atkinson_minus_approximation`
and `exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_atkinson_minus` now prove

```text
| integral_R exp(-((t-T)/G)^2) |zeta(1/2+it)|² dt - 2 Re(VY_A) |
  ≤ Cδ G log T,
integral_[T-G,T+G] |zeta(1/2+it)|² dt
  ≤ 2 exp(1) Re(VY_A) + Cδ G log T.
```

Here `VY_A=zetaAtkinsonBesselMinus(T,G,log T)` is the
complete actual phase-adjusted divisor sum with the literal Y0
kernel and its `-2pi` normalization. Both removed branches are
paid for by proved bounds; no amplitude, transform-error or moment
theorem is a parameter. The old unadjusted integral is not used in
place of the new source.

The literal Y0 expansion is now proved and consumed below. Next prove
the uniform oscillatory stationary reduction, retaining the complex amplitude
and complete arithmetic tails. The sharp Atkinson inequality,
physical dyadic/Gram assembly, genuine twelfth moment, EPZAE-21/37
and every unconditional `Add-est` output remain open.
The main-integral substep is complete, not the full Atkinson theorem.

The full EPZAE-00--41 goal, preserved Lemma 62 counterexample and
proved independent-coordinate powering/Heath–Brown chain remain
intact. Keep all nine modules, 38 named audits and 20 regressions
covered by `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`, update its backing
inventory as needed, and run it together with `run_lake_build.bat`
after Lean changes. Neither the goal nor verification scope is narrowed.


### Literal Neumann expansion and complete two-term zeta source

Thirteen production modules now prove and consume a two-term expansion
of the literal native `dfiBesselY0`. This is a kernel-checked source
component of EPZAE-21, not completion of that item or of Add-est.
They have 71 named public theorem audits and 25 semantic regressions.

The entry is proved from the existing Schläfli integral definition.
`NeumannContourKernel`, `NeumannContourShift` and
`NeumannSchlafliEntry` construct a Cauchy rectangle, prove absolute
integrability of its vertical rays and vanishing of the top side,
and pass the angular endpoint to the ray through one. The separate
principal powers `(1-z)^(-1/2)(1+z)^(-1/2)` keep both branches
explicit. `NeumannLaplaceRepresentation` cancels the actual
Schläfli tail and gives an exact decaying-ray formula for Y0.

`NeumannLaplaceAmplitude` proves, for every real u,

```text
|(1+iu)^(-1/2) - 1 + iu/2| ≤ 3u²/8.
```

`NeumannRayFactorization` links that amplitude to the actual ray.
`NeumannLaplaceMoments` evaluates its three required moments by
the Gamma integral and proves the exact coefficient `(1+i)/2`.
`NeumannLaplaceRemainder` integrates the error only after proving
integrability. `NeumannTwoTermExpansion` defines

```text
P(x) = sqrt(pi)/pi *
       ((sin x-cos x) x^(-1/2) - (sin x+cos x) x^(-3/2)/8),
K = (2/pi) (9/128) sqrt(pi) > 0,
|Y0(x)-P(x)| ≤ K x^(-5/2),  for every x>0.
```

The sign and both coefficients are exact; the error is proved, not
a DLMF assumption. `NeumannSourceBounds` proves measurability and
links `x≥T/16`, `T≥16`, `n≥1` to the literal argument
`4pi sqrt(nx)`. Its error is at most
`K T^(-5/4) n^(-5/4)`.

`ZetaNeumannRemainder` uses the actual phase-adjusted test
`gA=zetaAtkinsonDivisorTest(T,G,L)`. Both retained kernels and
their difference are integrable; the uniform mass bound gives a
remainder integral at most `C G n^(-5/4)`.
`ZetaNeumannSeries` consumes native Voronoi summability of the
original branch and the genuine ordinary-divisor series at 5/4.
It handles the zero coefficient explicitly and proves summability
of the complete new series

```text
W(T,G,L) = sum_n d(n) (-2pi) integral_(x>0) gA(x) P(4pi sqrt(nx)) dx,
|VY_A(T,G,L)-W(T,G,L)| ≤ C G.
```

The latter bound holds uniformly for `T≥16`, `G>0`,
`G²≤2T`, `L>0`, `8L≤G`. It is a complete arithmetic
replacement, not a finite-index or pointwise-only statement.

`ZetaAtkinsonTwoTermSource` derives all source scale hypotheses
at `L=log T` and consumes this replacement in the actual zeta
theorems. For each δ>0, one Cδ>0 and threshold T₀≥16 work for
every `T≥T₀` and `T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ)`:

```text
|integral_R exp(-((t-T)/G)²) |zeta(1/2+it)|² dt - 2 Re W(T,G,log T)|
  ≤ Cδ G log T,
integral_(T-G)^(T+G) |zeta(1/2+it)|² dt
  ≤ 2 exp(1) Re W(T,G,log T) + Cδ G log T.
```

The public consumers are
`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_atkinson_twoTerm_approximation`
and `exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_atkinson_twoTerm`. They assume
no amplitude, Bessel-expansion, summability, stationary-phase or
moment theorem. All actual source constants and normalizations
are retained.

Next evaluate this oscillatory series with uniform stationary
estimates for both signs, the actual complex amplitude and the
complete arithmetic tails. Exact saddle geometry alone does not
supply this estimate. The sharp Atkinson inequality, physical
dyadic/Gram assembly, genuine critical-line twelfth moment,
EPZAE-21/37 and every unconditional Add-est output remain open.

The original Lemma 62 counterexample remains byte-for-byte preserved.
The full EPZAE-00--41 goal and corrected independent-coordinate
powering/Heath–Brown chain are unchanged. Keep all thirteen modules,
71 named audits and 25 regressions in the root import graph and
the backing inventory of `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`.
Run that exact interface and `run_lake_build.bat` after Lean,
audit or inventory changes; neither verification scope is narrowed.

### Uniform signed-carrier bounds on the actual source

Ten further production modules prove frequency-uniform cancellation
for the actual power-weighted source, identify all four retained
Neumann carriers, and consume the complete series in the physical
zeta theorems. They have 43 named public theorem audits and 24
semantic regressions.

With `x=y²`, the exact normalized carrier is
`q(T,b,y)=(T/pi)log y-y²+2by`.
`zetaAtkinsonPhase_sq` proves the identity with the original
carrier, including its `2pi` normalization.
`AtkinsonRootPhase` differentiates q and its slope and factors
the slope at the actual positive saddle root r:

```text
q'(y)=2(r-y)(1+(r-b)/y),   r-b>0.
```

`AtkinsonFirstDerivative` consumes the pinned native monotone
reciprocal-slope estimate in both orientations. Beyond r±1 the
slope has magnitude at least 2. `AtkinsonRootIntegral` combines
the two tails with a central interval of length at most 2, proving

```text
|integral_a^c exp(2pi i q(T,b,y)) dy| ≤ 4
for every T>0, b real, and 0<a≤c.
```

`AtkinsonAmplitudeIntegral` proves that the square substitution
preserves the actual derivative-norm integral. Integration by parts
then gives the weighted bound `8M` for a concrete C1 amplitude
whose supremum and total variation are at most M.
`AtkinsonPowerWeight` constructs that bound from the actual
cutoff, rescaled power/Mellin profile, unit Gamma factor and
damped quadratic Gaussian. No amplitude estimate is a source premise.

`AtkinsonPowerIntegral` proves the positive-support restriction
and exact Jacobian identity. Its public consumer
`exists_norm_atkinsonPowerIntegral_le` gives, for every fixed
real α, one Cα>0 such that

```text
Iα(T,G,L,b)=integral_(x>0) gA(x) x^(-α) exp(4pi i b sqrt(x)) dx,
|Iα(T,G,L,b)| ≤ Cα G T^(-α)
```

for all `T>0`, `G>0`, `G²≤2T`, `L>0`, `8L≤G`
and every real b. In particular both `b=±sqrt(n)` are covered.

`AtkinsonCarrierAlgebra` and `AtkinsonCarrierIntegrals`
identify the actual two-term Neumann integral with its four
quarter-power carriers. Integrability is proved before using
linearity. The leading coefficients are `-(1±i)/2`;
the correction coefficients are `(1∓i)/2`, with the original
outer `sqrt(pi)/pi`, minus sign and `1/8` correction retained.
The Bessel-argument powers are linked to x and n exactly.
The full series retains `d(n)(-2pi)`, handles n=0 and is
proved summable by equality with the already convergent actual source.

`AtkinsonCarrierBounds` consumes the uniform integral estimates
in `exists_norm_zetaAtkinsonTwoTerm_le`. One pair C,D>0 works
for every admissible source and every natural n:

```text
|twoTermSummand(n)| ≤ |d(n)| G
  (C T^(-1/4)n^(-1/4) + D T^(-3/4)n^(-3/4)).
```

`AtkinsonCarrierSource` proves
`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_carrier_approximation` and
`exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_carriers`. They retain the complete
signed-carrier series, source factors 2 and 2 exp(1), and the same
uniform `Cδ G log T` error on `T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ)`, beyond
one threshold. They assume no analytic theorem.

These are cancellation bounds and exact source identities, not a
stationary main-value asymptotic. The displayed per-summand
majorants are not summable over all n and are never used as if they
were. Next prove the sharper far-frequency estimates and arithmetic
tail control, then the actual stationary main values with their
uniform source-scale error. The sharp Atkinson inequality, physical
dyadic/Gram assembly, genuine twelfth moment, EPZAE-21/37 and all
unconditional Add-est outputs remain open.

Keep these ten modules, 43 public audits and 24 regressions in the
root and backing inventory of `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`;
run it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes. Preserve
the original Lemma 62 counterexample byte-for-byte and the proved
independent-coordinate powering/Heath–Brown chain. The full
EPZAE-00--41 goal and both verification scopes remain unchanged.

### Complete correction removed; leading source retained

Four further production modules and a generalized weighted-primitive
lemma now prove the required summable correction estimate.
There are 19 new named public theorem audits and 16 semantic
regressions, in the root and exact batch-runner inventory.

`AtkinsonFrequencyTail` proves that on the full square-root
support `[sqrt(T/16),sqrt(T)]`, every `b≥8sqrt(T)` has

```text
q'(T,b,y) ≥ b,     q'(T,-b,y) ≤ -b.
```

Both phases have decreasing slope. The pinned native
first-derivative estimate and the proved actual amplitude variation
give `|Iα(T,G,L,±b)|≤Cα G T^(-α)/b`.
This holds on `T>0, G>0, G²≤2T, L>0, 8L≤G`.
`IntervalC1Bound.atkinsonRoot_of_primitive_bound` supplies
the weighted deduction; the earlier frequency-uniform bound is
also now a consumer of that proved lemma.

`AtkinsonCorrectionBounds` uses the uniform bound for
`sqrt(n)<8sqrt(T)` and the reciprocal-frequency gain in the
complement, including the equality boundary. For T≥1 the actual
correction pair has norm at most `C G/sqrt(n)` for n>0.
Its exact `n^(-3/4)` coefficient supplies the missing decay:

```text
|correctionTerm(n)| ≤ C G |divisorDirichletTerm(5/4,n)|,
|completeCorrection| ≤ C G.
```

The zero coefficient is handled separately. The genuinely
convergent ordinary-divisor series at 5/4 proves absolute
summability. `AtkinsonLeadingSeries` identifies the exact
leading-minus-correction decomposition and proves summability
of the complete leading source from the actual two-term source.
Neither phase, complex coefficient nor `d(n)(-2pi)` factor
is discarded. `exists_norm_zetaAtkinsonTwoTermSum_sub_leading_le`
consumes the full correction estimate, not just a pointwise bound.

`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_atkinson_leading_approximation`
and `exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_atkinson_leading` now retain
only the complete leading signed-carrier series. They preserve
source factors 2 and 2 exp(1) and uniform `Cδ G log T` error
on `T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ)`, beyond one threshold, with no
analytic theorem premise.

This closes the complete correction removal, not the leading
stationary main values or a sharp tail estimate for the leading
series. Those remain next, followed by the sharp Atkinson
inequality and physical dyadic/Gram assembly. The genuine twelfth
moment, EPZAE-21/37 and all unconditional Add-est outputs remain
open; the full EPZAE-00--41 goal is unchanged.

Keep these four modules, the weighted-primitive helper, all 19
audits and 16 regressions covered by
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`; update its backing inventory
and rerun it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes.
Preserve the original counterexample byte-for-byte and the proved
independent-coordinate powering/Heath–Brown chain.



## Source and dependency boundary

1. Primary paper: arXiv `2501.16779v1`, submitted 28 January 2025.
2. Paper-time ANTEDB snapshot: commit
   `9953003a48f46fe8075ccf9534321f98f656032e`, the last repository commit before
   the arXiv v1 submission time.
3. Current ANTEDB Lean snapshot: commit
   `088040634e8300f87e80f431d8bdc38c42cc8e11`, dated 4 September 2026.
4. Completed local Guth--Maynard foundation: the canonical source under
   `../71 Guth-Maynard, 2026/`, pinned by that project's own reproduction
   manifest and release tag.
5. Mathlib and `PrimeNumberTheoremAnd`: use only through a single selected
   toolchain/dependency graph after EPZAE-01 is resolved.

The paper-time snapshot is for historical reproduction of the optimization.
The current snapshot is for reusable Lean foundations. Never blur the two.

## Proof architecture

The project has three layers:

1. **Analytic semantics:** definitions and theorems about phase functions,
   exponential sums, zeta zeros, large-value patterns, and energy.
2. **Exact finite certificates:** rational arithmetic, affine envelopes,
   polyhedra, projection witnesses, interval partitions, and maximum/minimum
   comparisons.
3. **Public assembly:** the new exponent-pair, zero-density, and energy
   endpoints, consuming both previous layers through explicit theorems.

The finite-certificate layer must not assert that an analytic hypothesis is
true. The analytic layer must not bury an optimization result inside a
definition. The public layer must consume the actual upstream objects.

Module names may be refined, but every dependency edge in the architecture
must remain visible and audited.

## Integrity contract

- No `sorry`, `admit`, project `axiom`, conclusion-shaped theorem parameter,
  `native_decide`, `implemented_by`, or unsafe proof bypass.
- No floating upstream branch, unpinned source archive, or silently updated
  generated certificate.
- Generated Lean certificate files must be deterministic, reviewed, imported
  by the root module, and checked by the kernel.
- Every public theorem must have an explicit transitive axiom audit.
- Every source convention bridge must have semantic regression examples at
  endpoints and overlap points.
- All production modules must be in the default import graph and principal
  runner.
- Zero project warnings and linter diagnostics are required for release.

## Principal verification runner

`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` is a required part of the project contract,
not optional convenience tooling. It must be updated in the same change
whenever the package layout, production-module inventory, toolchain,
dependency pins, generated certificates, semantic regressions, public theorem
list, or axiom audit changes.

The runner must resolve the project from its own location, preserve a complete
timestamped log, support `--no-pause`, and return a nonzero exit code if any
required inventory, source hash, build, warning, semantic, integrity, or audit
gate fails. While no Lean package exists it must say `PLANNING SCAFFOLD ONLY`
and must not describe its result as a Lean build. Once the package is
installed, a release claim requires executing this exact runner successfully;
a direct `lake build` alone is insufficient.

## Release acceptance gates

A release may be called complete only when all of the following pass:

1. all frozen public statements elaborate exactly;
2. all supporting analytic inputs are proved or imported through exact proved
   bridges, with no remaining mathematical theorem parameter;
3. every rational and polyhedral certificate is replayed in Lean;
4. paper-time Python reproduction agrees with the frozen endpoint tables;
5. the source hashes and both ANTEDB pins pass;
6. the repository-wide shortcut scans pass;
7. `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat --no-pause` covers all production modules
   and completes with zero warnings;
8. the exhaustive dependency audit reports only permitted Lean/Mathlib logical
   axioms;
9. the architecture, checklist, crosswalk, research agenda, README, and
   reproduction manifest state the same completion status; and
10. semantic regression tests verify zero-count conventions, interval
    endpoints, multiplicity, epsilon-loss quantifiers, convex-hull membership,
    and every piecewise crossover;
11. the corrected two-witness powering theorem is proved on its full domain,
    and every powered optimization constraint is justified without the false
    fifth-coordinate scaling; and
12. the original Lemma 62 counterexample remains imported, explicitly audited,
    and covered by `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`, alongside the repaired
    theorem and its downstream consumers.

Until then, use the status terms **planned**, **defined/stated**,
**conditionally proved**, or **kernel-checked helper** as appropriate. Do not
say the paper or any advertised output is formalized.

### Actual second-order Fourier tails and finite leading source

Fifteen further production modules construct the actual second derivatives,
apply Fourier integration by parts, and consume the resulting arithmetic
tail in both physical zeta theorems. All 59 public theorems have named
dependency audits; 20 additional regressions check the actual source,
both frequency signs, closed scale boundaries, zero coefficients and
uniform source-consumer signatures.

For fixed real α, the new amplitude retains the power/Mellin profile,
actual exponential-edge cutoff, unit Gamma factor, quadratic Gaussian
and nonlinear phase. Its positive-root extension is smooth and supported
in [1/4,1]; the existing band supplies a neighbourhood of zero on which
it vanishes. No extra cutoff or assumed derivative bound is introduced.
On T≥1, G>0, G²≤2T, L≥1 and 8L≤G, its constructed C2 bound has
size Cα G T^(-α) and derivative scale T. The actual Gaussian second
derivative and both cutoff transition-width lower bounds are proved.

With ψ(u)=2log(u)-2pi u², the exact source identity is

```text
Iα(T,G,L,b) = 2sqrt(T) exp(i T log T) Fourier(Fα)(-2b sqrt(T)).
(1+|ξ|)² |Fourier(Fα)(ξ)| ≤ Cα G T^(-α) T².
b² |Iα(T,G,L,b)| ≤ Cα G T^(-α) T sqrt(T).
```

The source's square-root Jacobian, both signed frequencies and constant
unit phase are preserved. Native Fourier integration by parts is consumed
only after actual global smoothness, support and derivative bounds are proved.
The exact leading coefficient then gives

```text
|leadingTerm(n)| ≤ C G T^(5/4) |divisorDirichletTerm(5/4,n)|,
|leadingSum - sum_(n<N) leadingTerm(n)|
  ≤ C G T^(5/4) N^(-1/8)      (N>0),
|leadingSum - sum_(n<N) leadingTerm(n)| ≤ C G    (N≥T^10).
```

The true ordinary-divisor Dirichlet series at 9/8 sums the tail.
`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_atkinson_finite_approximation` and
`exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_atkinson_finite` consume it on
T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ), beyond one threshold depending only on δ>0,
for every natural N≥T^10. They retain the actual finite leading integrals,
source factors 2 and 2exp(1), and uniform Cδ G log T error, with no
analytic theorem premise.

This closes a **coarse polynomial truncation**, not the sharp Atkinson
inequality. The later continuations below prove evaluated stationary mains
and source-scale localization. A sufficiently strong summed stationary error
and final main assembly still precede sharp Atkinson and the physical
dyadic/Gram argument. The genuine twelfth moment, EPZAE-21/37 and all
unconditional Add-est outputs remain open.
The full EPZAE-00--41 completion contract is unchanged.

Maintain all fifteen modules, 59 named audits and 20 regressions in the
root graph and backing inventory of `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`;
update that runner as needed and rerun it and `run_lake_build.bat`
after relevant changes. Preserve the original Lemma 62 counterexample
byte-for-byte and the proved independent-coordinate powering/Heath–Brown chain.

### Actual finite-window stationary reduction and paired source phases

Twelve further production modules, from `AtkinsonSaddleNormalization`
through `AtkinsonStationaryPhysical`, now have 71 named public theorem
audits and 22 semantic regressions. The original counterexample and the
proved independent-coordinate powering/Heath–Brown chain are unchanged.

The actual positive saddle r=r(T/(2pi),b) satisfies r(b)r(-b)=T/(2pi).
The source logarithmic argument log(r²)-log(T/(2pi)) is exactly
2arsinh(b/(2sqrt(T/(2pi)))); the literal source
phase f(T,n) is linked to both b=±sqrt(n), including (-1)^n and both
pi/4 signs. The two actual quadratic Gaussians agree. On G²≤2T,
T>0 and G>0 their norm is bounded by
sqrt(pi) G exp(-G² n/(12T)) for n≤T. The cutoff and Mellin weights
at the two saddles are retained separately, not assumed conjugate.

Unlike the earlier Fourier amplitude, the stationary amplitude does
not include the nonlinear phase. Its constructed C2 size is
Cα G T^(-α) and derivative scale G/sqrt(T), on the actual root support.
The proof uses the true Gaussian damping in Q' and Q'', with fixed
profile, cutoff, power and unit Gamma factors. The cubic logarithmic
remainder gives the actual kernel error 4T|y-r|³/r³ on |y-r|≤r/2.
The outer weighted integrals are bounded using the actual total
variation and the proved reciprocal-slope test.

Write c=1+(T/(2pi))/r² and
F(c,H)=integral_(-H)^H exp(-2pi i c z²) dz. The finite main term is

```text
Mα(T,G,L,b,H) = 2 Wα(T,G,L,r²) exp(2pi i q(T,b,r)) F(c,H).
|Iα - Mα| ≤ Cα G T^(-α)
  [4/(pi H) + 4(G/sqrt(T)) H² + 16T H⁴/r³].
```

`exists_atkinsonPowerIntegral_finite_stationary_approximation`
proves this for all fixed real α, with one Cα before T,G,L,b,H,
on T>0, G≥1, G²≤2T, L≥1, 8L≤G, H>0,
[r-H,r+H]⊆[sqrt(T)/4,sqrt(T)] and H≤r/2.
It starts at the actual positive-support carrier integral, not a
separately supplied local integral or an assumed stationary estimate.

`exists_atkinsonPowerIntegral_small_n_pair_approximation` derives
all saddle/window conditions for both b=±sqrt(n) from
10000n≤T and H≤sqrt(T)/12. Its common bound replaces
16T H⁴/r³ by 432H⁴/sqrt(T). The signed-main identities consume
the exact phase and Gaussian bridges. The finite quadratic window
has not been replaced by an unproved Fresnel value.

The Fresnel limiting value, quantitative finite-window tail and sharp
source-scale localization are proved in the continuations below.
A sufficiently strong summed stationary error and final main assembly
remain before the sharp Atkinson local-mean inequality and physical
dyadic/Gram argument. This reduction does not prove the genuine twelfth moment. EPZAE-21/37, all unconditional
Add-est outputs and the full EPZAE-00--41 goal remain open.

Maintain all twelve modules, 71 named audits and 22 regressions in
the root and backing inventory of `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`;
update it as needed and rerun it and `run_lake_build.bat` after
relevant changes. Preserve Lemma 62's counterexample byte-for-byte,
the two separate corrected witnesses and every frozen public output.

### Evaluated Fresnel main terms and physical power saving

Nine additional modules, from `ContinuousKernelPrimitive` through
`AtkinsonStationaryPowerSaving`, now replace the finite quadratic window
by its proved limiting value. All 35 public theorems have named audits;
16 new regressions cover zero damping, the square-root branch, both
phase signs, the closed power-balance boundary and actual source consumers.

For c>0 and H>0 the locally proved statements are

```text
F(c,H) -> (1-i)/(2sqrt(c)) = exp(-i pi/4)/sqrt(2c),
|F(c,H) - exp(-i pi/4)/sqrt(2c)| <= 2/(c H pi).
```

The proof uses genuinely integrable positive-damping Gaussians, a
damping-uniform tail, and a zero-damping limit on each finite interval.
It does not assert a whole-line Lebesgue integral at zero damping.

`exists_atkinsonPowerIntegral_stationary_approximation` consumes that
tail and the constructed saddle amplitude. Its evaluated main is
Mα = 2 Wα(r²) exp(2pi i q(T,b,r)) exp(-i pi/4)/sqrt(2c).
The error retains the previous bracket with a larger uniform Cα.
`AtkinsonEvaluatedPhases` proves both actual signed identities:
the positive phase is exp(if(T,n)); the negative is -i exp(-if(T,n)).
Both retain (-1)^n, the central phase and their separate cutoff/Mellin
profiles, with the actual shared quadratic Gaussian.

Choosing H=T^η/12, for 0<η≤1/10 and 1≤G≤T^(1/2-3η), gives

```text
|Iα(T,G,L,b) - Mα(T,G,L,b)| <= Cα G T^(-α) T^(-η),
T>=1, L>=1, 8L<=G, |b|<=sqrt(T)/100.
```

The theorem derives G²≤2T and the actual saddle-window conditions.
`exists_atkinsonPowerIntegral_source_power_saving` then takes
η=min(δ/3,1/10), L=log T and T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ), beyond one
threshold for δ>0, proving both b=±sqrt(n) estimates for 10000n≤T
with one Cα independent of all physical parameters.

This remains a **per-carrier** estimate, not the full sharp Atkinson sum.
The source-scale truncation and linked cutoff proved below now resolve
the earlier N≥T^10 versus 10000n≤T mismatch. A sufficiently strong
summed stationary error is still needed before the sharp Atkinson inequality and physical
dyadic/Gram assembly. The genuine twelfth moment, EPZAE-21/37,
unconditional Add-est and the full EPZAE-00--41 goal remain open.

Maintain the nine root imports, 35 named audits, 16 regressions and
exact backing inventory of `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`; update
the runner as needed and rerun it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant
changes. Preserve the Lemma 62 counterexample byte-for-byte and the
proved independent-coordinate powering/Heath–Brown chain. No false
s scaling or third s-preserving witness may be reintroduced.

### Source-scale truncation and linked stationary cutoff

Eleven further modules, from `AtkinsonSaddleSupport` through
`AtkinsonSourceCutoff`, prove the actual source-scale tail and consume
it in both physical zeta theorems. All 53 public theorems have named
audits; 22 regressions cover both signs, cutoff endpoints, closed scale
boundaries, ceiling rounding and the actual uniform source statements.

The original smooth cutoff at either saddle forces |b|≤3sqrt(T)L/G.
Thus the evaluated stationary mains vanish for n>9T(L/G)².
The actual carrier, however, is not zero there: it is restricted exactly
to the original root band, whose length is at most 4sqrt(T)L/G.
Both true slopes are bounded away from zero once |b|≥6sqrt(T)L/G.
Two integrations by parts use the actual quotient amplitude, constructed
natural C2 bounds and proved vanishing endpoints to give

```text
|Iα(T,G,L,±sqrt(n))| <= Cα G² T^(-α) L / (sqrt(T) n),
n >= 36 T(L/G)²,
T>0, G>=1, G²<=2T, L>=1, 8L<=G.
```

The ordinary-divisor Dirichlet series at 5/4 then sums the complete
leading tail: `exists_norm_atkinsonLeadingSum_sub_band_finite_le`
bounds it by C G² L T^(-3/4) for every N≥36T(L/G)².
`exists_atkinsonLeading_source_band_bound` proves O(G) on the
original physical width range T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ), L=log T, eventually.
No tail estimate, endpoint condition or source support is assumed.

`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_atkinson_band_approximation`
and `exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_atkinson_band` consume that tail.
They retain the actual leading finite sum, source factors 2 and
2exp(1), and Cδ G log T error, now requiring only
N≥36T(log T/G)² rather than N≥T^10.

The explicit choice `atkinsonSourceCutoff = ceil(36T(L/G)²)`
satisfies the tail requirement. Eventually 10000N≤T on the lower
power-width range; `exists_atkinsonSourceCutoff_carrier_approximation`
therefore proves both existing evaluated stationary estimates for every
retained n<N. The earlier mismatch between the truncation range and
the small-frequency stationary range is resolved.

The symmetric continuation below now proves a **summed stationary error**
at and above the fourth-root width, with both actual physical zeta consumers.
The smaller-width error and remaining main-amplitude/source assembly still
precede the full sharp Atkinson inequality and physical dyadic/Gram argument.
The earlier per-carrier estimate alone is not claimed to establish this sum.
The genuine twelfth moment, EPZAE-21/37, unconditional Add-est and
the full EPZAE-00--41 goal remain open.

Maintain all eleven root imports, 53 named audits, 22 regressions and
the exact PowerShell inventory behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`;
update the runner as needed and execute it and `run_lake_build.bat`
after relevant changes. Preserve the original Lemma 62 counterexample
byte-for-byte and the proved independent-coordinate powering/
Heath–Brown chain. Never restore false s scaling.

### Symmetric stationary summation and physical zeta consumers

Ten further modules, from `StationaryOddRemainder` through
`AtkinsonStationaryZetaSource`, now have 43 named public theorem audits
and 24 regressions. The actual symmetric quadratic window cancels both
the amplitude's linear term and the phase's cubic term. Constructed C2
bounds and the true logarithmic quartic remainder control what remains.
The original outer tails and the proved Fresnel value are consumed.

The new balance is G X²≤sqrt(T), X⁴≤sqrt(T). Choosing
X=T^(1/4)/sqrt(G), H=X/12, derives these inequalities on
T≥1 and T^(1/4)≤G≤sqrt(T). For both b=±sqrt(n), 10000n≤T,
L≥1 and 8L≤G, the actual carrier estimate is

```text
|Iα(T,G,L,b)-Mα(T,G,L,b)| <= Cα G sqrt(G) T^(-α-1/4).
```

`atkinsonStationaryLeadingSum` retains the original divisor weights,
Bessel coefficients, both evaluated mains and their separate cutoff/
Mellin profiles. Its finite support follows from the original saddle
cutoff, and its sum equals the finite sum at the same explicit
`atkinsonSourceCutoff` used by the physical source.

Absolute convergence of the actual divisor Dirichlet series at 1+ε
gives a quarter-weighted prefix bound Cε N^(3/4+ε).
Ceiling rounding gives N≤37T L²/G². Combining these linked scales
and absorbing logarithms proves a retained error Oε(T^(1/4+ε)),
eventually on T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ) with G≥T^(1/4).
The complete leading-series difference is O(G+T^(1/4+ε)).

`exists_zetaSquarePhysicalGaussian_stationary_approximation` and
`exists_zetaSquareLocalMean_le_stationary` consume this complete error.
They retain the source factors 2 and 2exp(1), and prove error
Cδ,ε (G log T+T^(1/4+ε)). Their `above_fourthRoot` consumers
give Cδ,κ G log T when G≥T^(1/4+κ), κ>0.
All thresholds and constants precede T and G; no stationary, arithmetic
or zeta-source estimate is assumed.

This is not the full-width Ivić Theorem 6.2. Continue with the smaller-width
stationary error and remaining main-amplitude/source assembly. Any route
that omits smaller widths in the twelfth-moment argument must first prove
the corresponding lower-value-range reduction; do not assume that the new
fourth-root restriction is harmless. The sharp Atkinson theorem, physical
dyadic/Gram assembly, genuine twelfth moment, EPZAE-21/37, unconditional
Add-est and the full EPZAE-00--41 goal remain open.

Maintain all ten root imports, 43 named audits, 24 regressions and the exact
PowerShell inventory behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`; update it
as needed and execute it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes.
Preserve Lemma 62's counterexample byte-for-byte and the independent
ρ/k and ρ*/k witnesses with their proved Heath–Brown application.
Never restore false fifth-coordinate scaling or a third s-preserving witness.

## Normalized main terms and actual Abel consumer

Five production modules now continue the stationary series:
`AtkinsonMainNormalization`, `AtkinsonSignedPhaseSeries`,
`AtkinsonMainWeightBounds`, `AtkinsonMainPartialSummation` and
`AtkinsonMainZetaConsumer`. Their 30 public theorems have named audits;
24 `NormalizedMainAbelRegression` examples cover zero/one-index cases,
both signs, exact coefficients and all four physical consumer signatures.

The real saddle power and curvature cancel together. At alpha=1/4,
`atkinsonSaddleProfile_div_curvature` extracts the common factor
1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(sqrt(b²+2T/pi))) from the actual saddle profile.
The remaining factor is the actual Mellin profile times the original
cutoff, evaluated separately at b and -b; the Gamma phase is retained.

For n>0 the exact fourth-root coefficient is

```text
a(T,n) = (1/sqrt(2)) n^(-1/4) (n+2T/pi)^(-1/4).
```

The zero-index term is also handled with the original zero divisor weight.
`atkinsonStationaryLeadingSum_eq_signed` derives, from the original
Bessel coefficients and the proved finite-support theorem,

```text
stationary sum = (1+i) GammaPhase(T) exp(i centralPhase(T)) (Splus-Sminus).
```

Each S retains its own weight a(T,n) times the common actual quadratic
Gaussian times its separate cutoff/Mellin profile, multiplied by
(-1)^n d(n) exp(±i f(T,n)). Both sums use the same explicit source ceiling.
Only the raw negative-phase sums are proved conjugate to the positive
ones; no conjugacy or equality of the two weights is assumed.

`exists_norm_atkinsonMainWeights_le` constructs a uniform constant,
before T,G,L,n, bounding both actual weights by
C G T^(-1/4) n^(-1/4) exp(-G²n/(12T)) for n≤T,
T,G,L>0, G²≤2T and 8L≤G. It consumes the actual cutoff support,
the compact Mellin bound and the actual saddle Gaussian.

`atkinsonMainAbelBound` is the explicit endpoint term plus a finite sum
of literal differences of the two weights times raw phase partial sums.
Mathlib's finite summation-by-parts identity proves the bound at every
natural cutoff, including 0 and 1. It is not an assumed variation estimate.
The actual Gaussian consumer now has the normalized signed main term;
the actual local-mean consumer is bounded by 4exp(1) times this Abel quantity
plus Cδ,ε(G log T+T^(1/4+ε)), eventually on
T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ), G≥T^(1/4). The corresponding above-fourth-root
consumers have Cδ,κ G log T error when G≥T^(1/4+κ), κ>0.

The continuation below proves uniform variation of these actual weights
and the actual source-block bound. The newest continuation also proves
global dyadic assembly. The phase-sum/Gram estimate, source-form bridge,
and smaller-width error or a proved lower-value-range reduction remain required.
This is not the full sharp Atkinson theorem or the genuine twelfth moment.
EPZAE-21/37, every unconditional Add-est clause and the full goal remain OPEN.

Maintain these five root imports, all 30 named audits, all 24 regressions
and the exact PowerShell inventory behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`.
Update that batch interface and its implementation as needed, and execute
it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes. Preserve the original
counterexample byte-for-byte and the proved independent-coordinate
powering/Heath–Brown chain; never restore the false fifth-coordinate scaling.

## Damped main-weight variation and actual source blocks

Six additional production modules now close the uniform variation step:
`FiniteWeightVariation`, `AtkinsonGaussianVariation`,
`AtkinsonSaddleSamples`, `AtkinsonResidualVariation`,
`AtkinsonMainVariation` and `AtkinsonPhaseBlockBound`.
All 36 public theorems have named dependency audits; 24
`DampedWeightVariationRegression` examples check the actual objects,
both signs, empty blocks and closed physical boundaries.

`FiniteVariationBound f N M` records three proved inequalities:
M is nonnegative, every norm at indices 0 through N is at most M,
and the sum of adjacent norm differences over indices below N is at
most M. It is not an assumed zeta or exponential-sum estimate.
The generic product and ordered-sampling rules are applied to all four
factors of each actual normalized main weight.

For E(G,v)=exp(-(Gv)²/8), the actual complex Gaussian increment from
0≤a≤b is bounded by 2sqrt(pi) G (E(G,a)-E(G,b)).
The proof integrates the already proved actual derivative bound using
the exact real envelope primitive. The increasing saddle frequency
2arsinh(sqrt(pi n/(2T))) then gives a telescoping, damped variation bound.

The positive and negative normalized saddle roots are respectively
increasing and decreasing. On 10000(m+N)≤T their samples lie in [1/4,1],
where the actual Mellin profile has a constructed uniform Lipschitz bound.
Each original cutoff transition has variation at most one; their
product has variation at most two, independently of transition width.
The actual fourth-root coefficient is decreasing for positive indices.
These facts prove, for both separate weights Wplus and Wminus,

```text
sup_(0<=i<=N) |W(T,G,L,m+i)| <= B,
sum_(0<=i<N) |W(T,G,L,m+i+1)-W(T,G,L,m+i)| <= B,
B = C G T^(-1/4) m^(-1/4) exp(-G²m/(12T)).
```

`exists_finiteVariationBound_atkinsonMainWeights` constructs one C>0
before T,G,L,m,N. Its range is T,G,L>0, G²≤2T, m>0 and
10000(m+N)≤T. No 8L≤G premise or equality of the two residual weights
is needed. The supremum and variation are each bounded by B; their
sum is not asserted to be at most B.

`atkinsonStationaryBlock` is the sum of the original stationary
Bessel/divisor terms at m through m+N-1. Let A(T,m,N) be the maximum,
over 0≤j≤N, of the norm of the actual raw positive-phase sum at
m through m+j-1. Finite partial summation, both separate weight bounds
and the exact common source phase prove

```text
|atkinsonStationaryBlock(T,G,L,m,N)|
  <= C G T^(-1/4) m^(-1/4) exp(-G²m/(12T)) A(T,m,N).
```

`exists_atkinsonSourceCutoff_block_bound` is the actual-source consumer.
For each δ>0 it derives all preceding scale hypotheses beyond one
threshold T₀≥40000, from T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ), L=log T,
m>0 and m+N≤atkinsonSourceCutoff(T,G,log T).
In particular, it consumes the proved eventual smallness of that exact
ceiling cutoff; small-frequency geometry is no longer a premise here.
This block theorem applies throughout the original power-width range.
It does not alter the earlier stationary-error estimate, which still
requires G≥T^(1/4).

The next continuation now assembles the complete source with a faithful
finite dyadic partition and a truncated last block below the same cutoff.
The required maximal phase-sum/Gram estimate remains open.
A maximum of partial sums is not silently identified with Ivić's
endpoint-plus-integral expression. Smaller-width stationary errors or a
genuine lower-value-range reduction also remain required.
The sharp full-width Atkinson theorem, critical twelfth moment,
EPZAE-21/37, every unconditional Add-est clause and the full
EPZAE-00--41 goal remain OPEN. ZVB is green only for the proved variation
and actual source-block consumer.

Maintain all six root imports, 36 named audits, 24 regressions and the
exact PowerShell inventory behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`.
Update that batch interface and its implementation as needed; execute
it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes.
Preserve the original Lemma 62 counterexample byte-for-byte and the
proved independent ρ/k and ρ*/k witnesses with their actual Heath–Brown
application. Never restore false fifth-coordinate scaling or a third
s-preserving witness.

## Complete dyadic source assembly and physical zeta consumers

Three production modules, `TruncatedDyadicPartition`,
`AtkinsonDyadicMain` and `AtkinsonDyadicZetaConsumer`, now have
20 named public theorem audits and 24 semantic regressions.
They consume the previously proved actual block estimates rather than
assuming a bound for an abstract main sum.

For a natural cutoff N, block j starts at M=2^j and has length
min(M,N-M). The index range is j<clog(2,N), the natural ceiling
logarithm. Every retained block has positive length, starts strictly
below N and ends at or before N. At an exact power of two the last
block is full and no extra empty block is retained. The zero and one
cutoffs have no blocks.

`sum_range_eq_truncatedDyadic` proves the exact partition for every
additive sequence whose zero coefficient vanishes. The induction first
partitions a prefix ending at min(N,2^J); it never extends the source
to a larger power-of-two cutoff.
`atkinsonStationaryLeadingFiniteSum_eq_dyadic` applies that theorem
to the original stationary Bessel/divisor terms and their proved zero
coefficient. Both signs and their separate weights remain in each block.

Define A(T,M,K) as the maximum of the actual raw phase-prefix norms
on indices M through M+K-1. The complete stationary series is bounded
by C G T^(-1/4) times

```text
D(T,G,N) = sum_(j<clog(2,N))
  M^(-1/4) exp(-G²M/(12T)) A(T,M,min(M,N-M)),  M=2^j.
```

`exists_norm_atkinsonStationarySum_le_dyadic` sets
N=atkinsonSourceCutoff(T,G,log T), consumes the actual finite-support
identity and source-cutoff block theorem, and derives all support and
width hypotheses from T^δ≤G≤T^(1/2-δ), eventually for each δ>0.
Its constant and threshold precede T and G. This stationary-main bound
does not require G≥T^(1/4).

For later height estimates, `atkinsonPhaseBlockMax_mono` proves that
each shortened last-block phase maximum may be enlarged to A(T,M,M).
Only the raw phase maximum is enlarged: no stationary term, cutoff
support or small-frequency estimate is applied beyond N.
The resulting full-block sum is `atkinsonFullDyadicPhaseBound`,
denoted Dfull below. The public complete-series consumer
`exists_norm_atkinsonStationarySum_le_fullDyadic` proves the same
bound with Dfull in place of D.

Four physical consumers now apply this complete-series estimate to the
actual Gaussian and local zeta means. For both
I=integral_R exp(-((t-T)/G)²)|zeta(1/2+it)|² dt and
I=integral_(T-G)^(T+G)|zeta(1/2+it)|² dt, they prove

```text
I <= C_(delta,epsilon) [
  G T^(-1/4) Dfull(T,G,atkinsonSourceCutoff(T,G,log T))
  + G log T + T^(1/4+epsilon)],
```

eventually on the original power-width range with G≥T^(1/4).
Their `above_fourthRoot` versions replace the last two terms by
G log T when G≥T^(1/4+κ), κ>0. The original source factors are
absorbed into a uniform positive C, not dropped. The Gaussian theorem
is an upper bound, not an approximation identity after discarding
the main term's sign.

ZDA is green for exact dyadic assembly and these actual physical
consumers only. Next prove the maximal phase-sum/Gram estimate with
the required height scales and spacing. The inspected adjacent prefix
Gram theorem has one common prefix at every height and interval (K,2K];
it cannot be applied directly to these height-dependent maxima on [M,2M).
Prove the variable-prefix and endpoint bridges before reusing that result.
A maximum of raw phase prefixes
is still not identified with Ivić's endpoint-plus-integral expression.
Smaller-width stationary errors or a proved lower-value-range reduction
remain required as well. The genuine critical twelfth moment,
EPZAE-21/37, all unconditional Add-est clauses and the full
EPZAE-00--41 goal remain OPEN.

Maintain all three root imports, 20 named audits, 24 regressions and
the exact PowerShell inventory behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`.
Update that batch interface and its implementation as needed, and run
it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes.
Preserve the Lemma 62 counterexample byte-for-byte and the proved
independent ρ/k and ρ*/k witnesses and actual Heath–Brown application.
No false fifth-coordinate scaling or third s-preserving witness returns.

# Tao--Trudgian--Yang 2025 checklist

No item is complete at scaffold creation. A checked box requires the exact
acceptance test below, not merely a definition, a Python reproduction, or a
conditional wrapper.

Checklist identifiers use `EPZAE` for **exponent pairs, zero density, and
additive energy**, the three output families covered by the paper.

## Groundwork

- [ ] **EPZAE-00 -- Source freeze.** Primary PDF/TeX, both ANTEDB snapshots,
  relevant source papers, URLs, versions, licenses, and SHA-256 values are
  recorded and verified by a script.
- [ ] **EPZAE-01 -- Toolchain and dependency unification.** One pinned Lean and
  mathlib graph imports both the selected ANTEDB foundations and the completed
  Guth--Maynard source. A clean two-module spike builds with zero warnings.
- [ ] **EPZAE-02 -- Package/audit bootstrap.** Root module, production-module
  inventory, semantic regression file, exhaustive axiom audit, forbidden-
  shortcut scan, and warning-failing runner exist and pass for the bootstrap
  scope.

## Exact certificate layer

- [ ] **EPZAE-03 -- Rational-function signs.** Exact arithmetic normalizes the
  paper's rational bounds and proves every denominator positive on its claimed
  interval.
- [ ] **EPZAE-04 -- Piecewise envelopes.** Lean checks rational interval covers,
  affine/rational comparisons, crossover points, endpoint agreement, and
  finite max/min envelopes.
- [ ] **EPZAE-05 -- Convex/polyhedral certificates.** Convex-combination,
  half-space, projection, and optimization witnesses are represented as data
  with kernel-checked soundness theorems.
- [ ] **EPZAE-06 -- Deterministic generator.** A pinned script reproduces the
  certificate data from the paper-time ANTEDB snapshot; regeneration is
  byte-stable and Lean checks the generated result.

## Asymptotics and exponent pairs

- [ ] **EPZAE-07 -- ANTEDB asymptotic bridge.** The selected upstream definitions
  are reused or ported faithfully; automatic uniformity, power asymptotics,
  model phases, and exponent-sum growth compile in the target graph.
- [ ] **EPZAE-08 -- Exponent-pair semantics.** `ExponentPair (k,l)` unfolds to
  the intended uniform exponential-sum estimate, and the non-asymptotic
  equivalent is proved.
- [ ] **EPZAE-09 -- Convexity and duality.** Convex closure and both directions of
  beta/exponent-pair duality are kernel-checked, including endpoints and beta
  reflection.
- [ ] **EPZAE-10 -- A/B/C processes.** The three source transformations preserve
  exponent pairs with exact formulas.
- [ ] **EPZAE-11 -- Sargos D-process.** The beta bound is proved from the cited
  analytic theorem, then duality yields every D-derived exponent pair actually
  used downstream.
- [ ] **EPZAE-12 -- Heath--Brown derivative input.** The source kth-derivative
  estimate implies the paper's beta formula with all scale/range conditions.
- [ ] **EPZAE-13 -- Beta table.** Every segment consumed by `new-exp-pair` has a
  proved analytic source and a checked exact envelope certificate.
- [ ] **EPZAE-14 -- Four new exponent pairs.** The exact four public
  `new-exp-pair` conclusions are proved and audited without a conclusion-shaped
  hypothesis.
- [ ] **EPZAE-15 -- Zeta growth bridge.** Exponent-pair-to-`mu` and
  `mu(7/10) <= 3/40` are proved in the source convention.

## Large values

- [ ] **EPZAE-16 -- Large-value patterns.** Coefficients, dyadic support,
  interval length, one-separation, phase sign, and lower threshold are modeled
  exactly.
- [ ] **EPZAE-17 -- LV semantics.** `LV` and `LV_zeta` have faithful
  epsilon-loss and least-exponent/non-asymptotic interfaces.
- [ ] **EPZAE-18 -- Elementary LV calculus.** Subdivision, lower/L2 bounds,
  obvious bounds, and raising-to-a-power are proved with uniform coefficient
  normalization.
- [ ] **EPZAE-19 -- Classical LV inputs.** Exact consumed Huxley, Jutila,
  Heath--Brown, twelfth-moment, and Bourgain interfaces are proved/imported.
- [ ] **EPZAE-20 -- Guth--Maynard bridge.** The completed local theorem proves the
  exact `guth-maynard-lvt` interface after all convention conversions; no
  generic restatement is accepted as a bridge.
- [ ] **EPZAE-21 -- Zeta LV inputs.** Reflection, moment, and
  `LV_zeta = -infinity`/nonexistence statements used by density are proved.

## Zero density

- [ ] **EPZAE-22 -- Zero-count convention.** The paper's multiplicity-weighted
  `N(sigma,T)` and local rectangle count are related by a proved exact bridge.
- [ ] **EPZAE-23 -- Density exponent.** `A(sigma)` and its non-asymptotic
  epsilon-loss interface are defined faithfully.
- [ ] **EPZAE-24 -- LV-to-density transfer.** `zero-from-large` and all corollaries
  used in the paper consume actual large-value patterns and actual zeta zeros.
- [ ] **EPZAE-25 -- Classical density bridges.** Local Ingham, Huxley, and
  Guth--Maynard public theorems instantiate the paper's interfaces exactly.
- [ ] **EPZAE-26 -- Improved Heath--Brown density.** `hb-density2` is proved on
  `7/10 < sigma <= 1` with the correct endpoint handling.
- [ ] **EPZAE-27 -- Improved Bourgain density.** The max formula and both stated
  subranges of `bourgain-density-improved` are proved.
- [ ] **EPZAE-28 -- Bourgain pair-to-density theorem.** All hypotheses and the
  two alternative side conditions of `bourgain-zd` are formalized.
- [ ] **EPZAE-29 -- Optimized Bourgain density.** All eight pieces, admissibility
  checks, crossovers, and interval coverage are proved.
- [ ] **EPZAE-30 -- Best-known density table.** The source table is reproduced as
  a proved envelope from individually identified theorems; it is validation,
  not a substitute for EPZAE-26--29.

## Additive energy

- [ ] **EPZAE-31 -- Additive-energy semantics.** Approximate quadruple energy of
  an indexed multiset is defined with unit tolerance and multiplicity; the
  paper's basic bounds are proved.
- [ ] **EPZAE-32 -- Energy exponents/regions.** `LV*`, `LV*_zeta`, `A*`, `E`, and
  `E_zeta` have faithful asymptotic and non-asymptotic interfaces.
- [ ] **EPZAE-33 -- Energy-density transfer.** `zeroe-from-large` and its
  corollary preserve bounded perturbations and zero multiplicity.
- [ ] **EPZAE-34 -- Energy powering.** The source's three possibly different
  output witnesses are formalized without strengthening them into one witness.
- [ ] **EPZAE-35 -- Heath--Brown relation.** The exact two-max five-variable
  inequality is proved from the cited large-values estimate.
- [ ] **EPZAE-36 -- Energy optimization certificates.** Every projection and
  piecewise maximum needed by clauses (i)--(ix) has a checked rational
  certificate and denominator/range proof.
- [ ] **EPZAE-37 -- Nine new energy estimates.** Every clause of `Add-est` is
  proved on its exact interval and audited.

## Release

- [ ] **EPZAE-38 -- Public assembly.** One public module exports all advertised
  new results with exact source-facing statements and no mathematical theorem
  parameters.
- [ ] **EPZAE-39 -- Semantic regressions.** Tests cover zero rectangles,
  multiplicity, approximate energy, phase sign, coefficient support,
  epsilon-loss quantifiers, and every table crossover/endpoint.
- [ ] **EPZAE-40 -- Final reproduction.** Clean source hashes, paper-time Python
  reproduction, deterministic certificate regeneration, full build, zero
  warnings, repository-wide integrity scans, and exhaustive axiom audit all
  pass in one logged runner invocation.
- [ ] **EPZAE-41 -- Documentation synchronization.** README, goal prompt,
  checklist, crosswalk, research agenda, architecture, sources, and manifest
  make identical claims and cite the exact public theorems.

## Completion rule

The paper-level project is complete only when EPZAE-00 through EPZAE-41 are all
checked. If one advertised output remains conditional, disconnected from its
real upstream object, outside the build, or absent from the axiom audit, the
project remains incomplete.

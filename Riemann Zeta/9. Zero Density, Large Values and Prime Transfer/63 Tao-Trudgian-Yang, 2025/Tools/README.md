# Tooling record

Current analytic progress: [Jutila physical-scale smoothing and uniform pattern bounds](#jutila-physical-scale-smoothing-and-uniform-pattern-bounds--current-checkpoint).
The moments and full-domain clauses (i)--(ii) are proved; clauses (iii)--(ix) and the full goal remain open.
Earlier checkpoint sections retain historical status and next-step notes;
the frozen public contract is unchanged.


The human-facing build runner now verifies the unified Lean package, frozen
ANTEDB source ledger, source archive hashes, forbidden-shortcut policy,
semantic regressions, and dynamic transitive axiom audit. It writes a complete
timestamped log and supports `--no-pause`.

Installed and planned tools:

- `verify_sources.ps1` -- recompute `Sources/SHA256SUMS.txt`, check archive
  commit metadata, and fail on missing/unlisted files;
- `generate_certificates.py` -- installed standard-library extractor that
  verifies the paper-time archive hash, extracts the four new-pair
  coordinates, reconstructs the eight exact Bourgain lower-envelope pieces,
  extracts and sign-normalizes all nine energy-clause tables from the frozen
  blueprint, and deterministically emits their kernel-consumed rational data
  module;
- `reproduce_paper_time.py` -- future tool to invoke pinned ANTEDB functions for the 2025
  outputs and serialize exact rational results;
- `emit_certificates.py` -- future full conversion of exact rational witnesses to deterministic
  Lean data, never theorem declarations;
- deterministic regeneration/diff checking for the installed generated module
  is integrated directly into the principal runner;
- `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.ps1` -- installed warning-failing Lake build,
  semantic-regression, axiom-audit, integrity, inventory, and pin orchestrator;
  its inventory now rejects unlisted Lean files and production modules absent
  from the root imports, and its warning gate covers filename-prefixed Lean
  diagnostics as well as bare warning lines;
  the preserved `EnergyPoweringObstruction`, the `EnergyPowering` interfaces,
  and all three full-proof modules (`EnergyPoweredPatterns`,
  `EnergyPoweringLimits`, `CorrectedEnergyPowering`) are in its production
  inventory; both obstruction and repair reports are required project files;
  the downstream `EnergyPoweringBounds`, `EnergyLogLimits`,
  `HeathBrownEnergyFinite`, `HeathBrownEnergy`, `ClassicalLargeValueRegions`,
  `EnergyClauseOneGeneral`, `EnergyClauseOneZeta`, `ZetaMomentKernel`,
  `ZetaMomentTransfer`, `ZetaMomentAsymptotics`, `ZetaIntervalCutoff`,
  `ZetaMellinEntry`, `ZetaMellinContour`, and `ZetaMellinShift` modules are
  covered as well, including their exact source-entry audits and regressions;
  the uniform continuation (`ZetaCutoffDerivatives`, `ZetaMellinDerivative`,
  `ZetaMellinUniform`, `ZetaMellinLocalization`, `ZetaPerronEntry`,
  `ZetaTwelfthFromMoment`) is inventoried with 39 named public theorem
  audits, the derivative-test constructor audit, and 14 regressions;
  `ZetaShortPerron`, `ZetaShortPatterns`, and `EnergyClauseOneFromMoment`
  are also inventoried and root-imported. Their original 11 public theorems and
  the new short-height theorem in `ZetaTwelfthFromMoment` have 12 named
  audits; eight additional regressions check source boundaries and the
  final clause-(i) signature with only the genuine moment hypothesis;
  `ZetaLargeValueDiscreteness` and `ZetaPointwiseNonexistence` are now
  inventoried and root-imported too. Together with the new sharp-interval
  consumer in `ZetaShortPatterns`, they add 13 named theorem audits and
  eight regressions for infimum semantics, negative/zero/positive branches,
  and the genuine pointwise conclusion. The analytic twelfth moment is
  still open;
  the six modules `ZetaSquareContour`, `ZetaSquareContourShift`,
  `ZetaSquareDivisorKernel`, `ZetaSquareDivisorSeries`,
  `ZetaSquareSourceEntry`, and `ZetaSquareLocalMean` are inventoried and
  root-imported, with 47 named theorem audits and nine source-entry
  regressions. Coverage includes absolute integrated-norm summability
  and the actual local second-moment identity, not a claimed proof of
  the sharp Atkinson estimate;
  `ZetaSquareAveraging`, `ZetaSquareGaussianTail`, and
  `ZetaSquareGaussianTransform` are covered with 31 named theorem audits
  and nine additional regressions. These test physical Gaussian
  normalization, uniform logarithmic tails, and the closed quadratic
  transform boundary. Four further modules cover the proved actual
  digamma/Gamma-phase approximation and its whole-line Gaussian
  transform, now with 26 named audits and 12 phase regressions. Seven
  further modules prove the uniform actual shifted-Gamma/pole error,
  whole normalized contour bound and complete reflected divisor-source
  remainder. They add 44 public audits (plus the promoted Gamma derivative
  audit counted above) and 14 regressions. All seven are required by the
  same root import/inventory check. Nine more modules cover actual
  Mellin weights/reflection, signed source arguments, height variation,
  square-root coefficient mass, freezing, real zeta normalization and
  the complete quadratic Gaussian-source comparison. All 78 new public
  theorems have named audits; 20 additional regressions test zero
  coefficients, both closed height boundaries, the Gaussian scale
  boundary, factor two, and the full source-consumer quantifiers.
  Six further modules cover the exact finite frequency band, Gaussian
  shortening tail, uniform logarithmic scale/error assembly, actual
  local-second-moment consumer and physical divisor support. Their
  29 public theorem audits and 18 regressions are required by the same
  root/inventory gate. Eight further required modules construct the
  entire weight, actual smooth cutoff and native test, pay transition
  tails, and consume native Voronoi and literal Bessel bridges. Their
  43 public audits and 18 regressions are included in the same gates.
  Seven further modules prove literal K0 decay, full smooth support
  and mass, actual integrability, complete divisor summation, arbitrary
  power saving and source removal. All 29 public audits and 16
  regressions are included in the same root/inventory gates. Six further
  required modules insert the lattice phase, reapply native Voronoi,
  transfer the complete K0 bound and remove it from the actual physical
  source; exact carrier factorization and unique nondegenerate saddle
  calculus are also proved. All 40 public audits and 22 regressions
  are covered by the root and batch inventory. Nine further modules
  prove the actual amplitude variation, phase-adjusted main-integral
  bound and its physical-source removal, leaving the complete Y0 sum.
  Their 38 public audits and 20 regressions are included. Thirteen further
  required modules prove the literal Y0 ray and two-term expansion,
  sum its actual arithmetic remainder and consume the complete replacement
  in both physical zeta theorems. All 71 public audits and 25 regressions
  are covered by the same root and exact inventory gate. Ten further
  required modules prove uniform signed-carrier cancellation, actual
  power-weight bounds, exact four-carrier algebra and integrability,
  complete-series summability and both physical zeta consumers.
  Their 43 public audits and 24 regressions are included in the same
  root and backing inventory. The summand majorants are not used as
  summable arithmetic bounds. Four further modules and the generalized
  weighted-primitive helper prove the actual far-frequency gain,
  a summable majorant for the complete correction, its `C G`
  bound and leading-only physical zeta consumers. Their 19 new
  public audits and 16 regressions are in the same root/inventory
  gates. Leading stationary main values and sharper leading tails,
  sharp Atkinson inequality
  and genuine twelfth moment remain open, not assumed or excluded;
- `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` -- human-facing wrapper at the project root, with
  `--no-pause` support for agents and CI.

Every tool must print the exact input pins and preserve complete stdout/stderr
in the reproduction log. A tool exit code is not proof evidence unless its
output is consumed by a Lean kernel-checked certificate theorem.

## Second-order Fourier and finite-source coverage

The root and backing inventory now also cover fifteen modules from
`ZetaQuadraticGaussianSecondDerivative` through `AtkinsonFiniteSource`.
All 59 new public theorems have named audits, and 20 additional semantic
regressions check the actual amplitude, both signed source frequencies,
scale boundaries, zero coefficients and physical finite-source signatures.
This earlier tail gate proves C G for N≥T^10. The source-scale truncation
coverage below now supplies the shorter cutoff.
No incomplete module is excluded and no warning gate is weakened.

Keep `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its backing inventory
synchronized; run it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes.
The Reproduction Manifest records terminal verification evidence.

## Finite stationary reduction coverage

The root and exact PowerShell inventory now cover twelve additional modules
from `AtkinsonSaddleNormalization` through `AtkinsonStationaryPhysical`.
All 71 public theorems have named dependency audits. The 22 new regressions
cover both phases, (-1)^n, zero frequency/window, equal paired Gaussians,
closed G²=2T and n=T damping boundaries, both logarithmic-remainder
endpoints, natural derivative scale and actual full-source consumers.
Physical saddle-window containment is derived for 10000n≤T.

No source hash, dependency pin, exclusion or warning gate changed.
Keep `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` synchronized as this chain changes;
both it and `run_lake_build.bat` remain required. A passing runner checks
this finite-window scope. Fresnel evaluation is now proved below;
sharp Atkinson, the genuine twelfth moment and unconditional Add-est
outputs remain open.

## Fresnel evaluation and source power-saving coverage

Nine additional production modules, `ContinuousKernelPrimitive`,
`FresnelDampedTails`, `FresnelGaussianComparison`, `FresnelAbelLimit`,
`FresnelEvaluation`, `AtkinsonStationaryMain`,
`AtkinsonStationaryEvaluation`, `AtkinsonEvaluatedPhases` and
`AtkinsonStationaryPowerSaving`, are root-imported and explicitly
inventoried. All 35 public theorems have named audits; 16 regressions
check zero damping, branch choice, both signs, the closed power-balance
boundary and actual uniform source consumers.

No warning gate, source pin or exclusion changed. Maintain
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its PowerShell inventory as this
chain grows; execute it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes.
A PASS verifies this per-carrier scope, not sharp summed stationary errors,
the twelfth moment or unconditional Add-est. See the Reproduction Manifest.

## Source-scale truncation coverage

The eleven modules from `AtkinsonSaddleSupport` through
`AtkinsonSourceCutoff` are explicitly inventoried and root-imported.
All 53 public theorems have named dependency audits.
The 22 new regressions cover actual endpoint vanishing, both slope signs,
closed G²=2T and frequency thresholds, literal ceiling values and the
uniform physical zeta and retained-index stationary consumers.

The runner now covers a complete source-scale leading-tail estimate,
not only the older N≥T^10 truncation. No warning gate, source pin or
exclusion changed. Maintain `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its
PowerShell inventory; execute it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant
changes. Kernel integrity does not close summed stationary errors,
the genuine twelfth moment or unconditional Add-est.

## Symmetric stationary summation coverage

The ten modules from `StationaryOddRemainder` through
`AtkinsonStationaryZetaSource` are root-imported and explicitly inventoried.
All 43 public theorems have named audits. The 24 regressions include
both amplitude endpoints, both logarithmic Taylor endpoints, the
small/large exponential-error branches, reversed odd-integral orientation,
closed radius balances, the empty divisor prefix, literal cutoff 18,
complete stationary-series support and exact uniform physical consumers.

Keep `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its backing PowerShell inventory
synchronized; execute it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes.
Their integrity verdict does not close smaller source widths, final main
assembly, the twelfth moment or unconditional Add-est. No diagnostic gate
or exclusion changed.

## Normalized main and partial-summation checkpoint

Five new modules, 30 named audits and 24 regressions derive the actual
common fourth-root coefficient from the original saddle power, curvature
and Bessel constants. Both signed main sums retain separate cutoff/Mellin
weights. Only the raw phase sums are conjugated.

The actual weights have a proved uniform bound
C G T^(-1/4) n^(-1/4) exp(-G²n/(12T)) on n≤T,
T,G,L>0, G²≤2T and 8L≤G. The exact Abel bound retains literal finite
weight differences. Both physical zeta consumers are linked to the same
explicit source cutoff and normalized mains. Errors remain
Cδ,ε(G log T+T^(1/4+ε)) for G≥T^(1/4), or Cδ,κ G log T above
T^(1/4+κ), within the original power-width range.

The continuation below proves uniform damped variation and the actual
source-block bound. Global dyadic/Gram assembly, smaller source widths or
a proved lower-value-range reduction, and the genuine twelfth moment remain open. No unconditional Add-est clause is closed.
The original counterexample and corrected powering/Heath–Brown chain
are unchanged. The exact `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` inventory
is synchronized; maintain it and rerun both principal evaluation scopes.

## Damped variation and source-block checkpoint

Six new modules, from `FiniteWeightVariation` through
`AtkinsonPhaseBlockBound`, have 36 named public audits and 24 regressions.
The actual Gaussian increments telescope against a decreasing real
envelope. Ordered actual saddle samples, the constructed Mellin bound,
both original cutoff transitions and the decreasing fourth-root
coefficient give uniform variation for both separate normalized weights.

`exists_finiteVariationBound_atkinsonMainWeights` bounds both the
supremum on indices 0..N and the adjacent-difference sum by
C G T^(-1/4) m^(-1/4) exp(-G²m/(12T)), for
T,G,L>0, G²≤2T, m>0 and 10000(m+N)≤T.
No 8L≤G condition or conjugacy of residual weights is assumed.

The actual stationary Bessel/divisor block at m..m+N-1 is bounded by
that same shape times the maximum of the actual raw phase partial sums,
with a larger uniform C. `exists_atkinsonSourceCutoff_block_bound`
derives its small-frequency and scale conditions for every retained
block from the original power-width range and the exact source ceiling
cutoff, beyond a δ-dependent threshold.

ZVB records these proved consumers; the continuation below also proves
global dyadic assembly. The phase-sum/Gram bound, smaller-width stationary errors or a proved
lower-value-range reduction, and the genuine twelfth moment remain open.
The block theorem has no fourth-root-width restriction; the earlier
stationary-error/zeta consumer still does. No unconditional Add-est
clause or full EPZAE-00--41 completion is claimed.

The original counterexample and independent-coordinate powering/
Heath–Brown chain are unchanged. The exact
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` root/audit/PowerShell inventory is
synchronized; maintain it and rerun both principal evaluation scopes.
See the Reproduction Manifest for the semantic audit and terminal evidence.

## Complete dyadic-source checkpoint

Three new modules, `TruncatedDyadicPartition`, `AtkinsonDyadicMain`
and `AtkinsonDyadicZetaConsumer`, have 20 named public audits and
24 regressions. The exact partition uses M=2^j and block length
min(M,N-M), for j<clog(2,N). Every retained endpoint stays at or below
the original cutoff; zero/one cutoffs and exact powers of two are covered.

The actual complete stationary Bessel/divisor series is now bounded by
C G T^(-1/4) times the sum of
M^(-1/4) exp(-G²M/(12T)) times the actual block phase-prefix maximum.
The same source ceiling cutoff supplies every block's small-frequency
geometry. Enlarging only the last raw phase maximum to a full block
does not enlarge the stationary source.

Four Gaussian/local-mean consumers use this complete dyadic bound.
Their error remains Cδ,ε(G log T+T^(1/4+ε)) for G≥T^(1/4), or
Cδ,κ G log T for G≥T^(1/4+κ), within the original power-width range.
The stationary-main bound itself has no fourth-root-width restriction.
ZDA records this exact assembly and these physical consumers.

Global dyadic assembly is now proved; the continuation below proves
finite maximal-prefix Gram assembly. The numerical phase-difference
estimates, source-form bridge, smaller-width errors or a proved
lower-value-range reduction, and the genuine twelfth moment remain open.
No unconditional Add-est clause or full-goal completion is claimed.

The counterexample and corrected powering/Heath–Brown chain are unchanged.
Maintain the synchronized root, audits, regressions and exact backing
inventory of `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`; run it and
`run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes. The Reproduction Manifest
records the separate semantic and terminal integrity evidence.

## Height-dependent maximal Gram checkpoint

Eight production modules, from `FinitePrefixGram` through
`AtkinsonGramPhysicalCutoff`, add 41 named public theorem audits
and 24 `HeightDependentPrefixGramRegression` examples.

Finite Gram duality now consumes the actual divisor coefficients and
raw phase sums on [M,M+j). Each height has its own maximizing prefix;
the exact paired Gram entry uses the minimum of the two prefix lengths.
Its finite maximum has diagonal M and is symmetric in the two heights.
The separate arithmetic theorem proves coefficient energy
E(M,N)≤Cε M^(1+ε) for 0<M and N≤M; it does not assert a sharp
logarithmic divisor-square asymptotic.

The actual complete stationary packet and two actual local-mean excess
packets now consume the maximal Gram inequality. Their common cutoff is
derived from the source: for heights in [H,2H], it is bounded by
ceil(72H(log(2H)/G)²). The nonnegative Gram budget, not the stationary
source, is enlarged. Gaussian damping is removed by a proved upper bound;
the final budget retains literal coefficient energy E.

The stationary packet bound requires only the original power-width
range, eventually. The local-mean excess subtracts the proved error
Cδ,ε(G log t+t^(1/4+ε)) with G≥t^(1/4), or Cδ,κ G log t with
G≥t^(1/4+κ). Those restrictions are not discharged.
ZMG is DONE for finite maximal Gram assembly and these actual physical
consumers. The continuation below proves uniform truncated cancellation and its
physical consumers; ZGB retains separated-height summation and scale
optimization as open.

The source-form bridge, smaller-width error or a proved lower-value
reduction, genuine twelfth moment and unconditional Add-est remain open.
EPZAE-21/37 and the complete EPZAE-00--41 goal are unchanged.
The original counterexample and proved independent powering/
Heath–Brown chain remain intact; no false fifth-coordinate scaling returns.

Maintain all eight root imports, 41 named audits, 24 regressions and
the exact PowerShell inventory behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`.
Update that interface and its implementation as needed, and run it and
`run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes. The Reproduction Manifest
records semantic fidelity separately from terminal build/audit evidence.

## Uniform truncated cancellation and numerical source budgets

Thirteen production modules, from `AtkinsonIndexPhase` through
`AtkinsonArithmeticGapPackets`, add 79 named public theorem audits
and 30 `TruncatedPhaseCancellationRegression` examples.

The literal source phase now has proved real-index slope, curvature,
height variation and uniform box bounds. Native second-derivative
cancellation and decreasing-increment Kusmin–Landau are applied to
every prefix [M,M+j), j≤N, with fixed ambient parameters. The result
covers empty prefixes, both height orders and the exact diagonal.
It is not an application of a full-block bound to an unknown prefix.

The resulting numerical entry majorant takes the minimum of N, the
explicit B-process expression and, when its exact half-period condition
holds, the reciprocal-gap first-derivative bound. It retains the physical
height gap and radical scales; no oscillatory sum remains in this
majorant.

The actual cutoff at 2H supplies every full block's two extra mean-value
endpoints: eventually 2*ceil(72H(log(2H)/G)²)+2≤H from H^δ≤G.
That lower-width condition is derived from an actual height in a
nonempty source packet; empty packets are handled separately.

All three actual stationary/local-excess packets consume the numerical
entry bounds. The final `arithmeticGap` versions also consume
E(M,M)≤Cη M^(1+η), yielding the explicit dyadic weight M^(1/2+η).
Their right sides have no unevaluated phase sum or coefficient-energy
sum. The local-mean errors and G≥t^(1/4), or G≥t^(1/4+κ), remain
unchanged; the stationary-only bound has no such restriction.

ZPC is DONE for uniform truncated cancellation, derived physical
geometry and these actual numerical consumers. ZGB is OPEN for
separated-height summation of the explicit gap bounds and scale
optimization. No height-separation estimate is claimed by the present
finite double sum. The source-form bridge, smaller-width error or a
proved lower-value reduction, genuine twelfth moment and unconditional
Add-est remain open. EPZAE-21/37 and the full EPZAE-00--41 goal are
unchanged.

Maintain all thirteen root imports, 79 named audits, 30 regressions and
the exact backing inventory of `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`.
Update that interface and its implementation as needed and run both
principal evaluation scopes. The original counterexample remains
byte-preserved, with the corrected independent powering witnesses and
actual Heath–Brown application intact. No false fifth-coordinate
scaling or third witness returns. See the Reproduction Manifest for
the separate semantic and terminal verification evidence.

## Constructed covering and local-mean counts — preceding checkpoint

EPZAE-21 now proves a sixth-power superlevel counting estimate for
the actual critical-line local zeta integral. For every δ>0, ε>0
and ν>0 there are C,D>0 and H0≥40000, before H,G,Y,W, such that

```text
card {t in W : C*(G*log(t)+t^(1/4+ε)) + Y
                 <= integral_(t-G)^(t+G) |zeta(1/2+i*u)|^2 du}
 <= D*H^ν * (H/(G*Y^2) + H^2/Y^6).
```

The hypotheses are H≥H0, G>0, Y>0, G-separation of W, and for
each t in W, `H<=t<=2H`,
`t^δ<=G<=t^(1/2-δ)`, and `t^(1/4)<=G`.
The above-fourth-root version instead has error `C*G*log(t)`
and requires `t^(1/4+κ)<=G`, κ>0. All source restrictions
remain explicit. Both theorems count the literal integral's
superlevel set; no analytic packet estimate, prescribed covering,
absorption inequality or cardinality bound is a premise.

The preceding physical packet theorem remains installed:
the square of the sum of actual excesses is at most
`D0*H^a*(R*H/G+R^2*sqrt(G*L))`, with uniform constants
before the localization interval. Its cutoff/logarithmic optimization,
including the literal source ceiling and derived width bounds,
is unchanged.

The new deduction constructs the length and bins. Put
`A=D0*H^a` and `L=(Y^2/(4*A))^2/G`. Then L>0 and

```text
sqrt(G*L) = Y^2/(4*A)
2*A*sqrt(G*L) <= Y^2.
```

The bin of t is `floor((t-H)/L)`. Its actual fiber is contained
in `[H+k*L,H+(k+1)*L]`; the bins partition W for
`0<=k<floor(H/L)+1`. This includes the terminal height 2H,
even when H/L is integral. Separation and every original source
range are inherited by each fiber.

On a fiber whose actual excess is at least Y, the packet inequality
and the proved absorption give `R<=2*A*H/(G*Y^2)`.
Summing the exact fiber cardinalities and paying the final bin gives

```text
card(W) <= 2*A*H/(G*Y^2) + 32*A^3*H^2/Y^6.
```

Choosing the packet exponent a=ν/3 and absorbing constants yields
the displayed global estimate. The exact positive-threshold
equivalence between excess≥Y and integral≥error+Y is proved,
then used on the actual filtered superlevel set.

Four root-reachable modules are installed:
`AtkinsonCardinalityAbsorption`, `AtkinsonHeightCover`,
`AtkinsonGlobalCardinality` and `AtkinsonLocalMeanCounting`.
All 17 new public theorems have named audits. The 27 new regressions
cover every public theorem type, exact chosen-length arithmetic,
empty fibers, unit/terminal bins, zero threshold geometry and the
complete source-consumer signatures. Earlier work remains installed.

ZLC is complete for constructed covering, absorption and actual
local-mean superlevel counting. This is not yet a pointwise zeta
large-value count: the entry from point values to these local
integrals, a compatible physical width choice, an occupancy-preserving passage
from unit-separated points to G-separated local windows, and the
remaining value-range reduction are still required. ZGB, ZAT, the genuine
critical twelfth moment ZTM, all unconditional Add-est conclusions,
EPZAE-21/37 and the full EPZAE-00–41 goal remain OPEN.

Preserve the original Lemma 62 counterexample byte-for-byte.
The corrected independent ρ/k and ρ*/k witnesses, independent
fifth coordinates and actual Heath–Brown application are unchanged.
Never restore false s-scaling or a third s-preserving witness.
Maintain and update `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its
backing implementation as needed; its exact inventory includes
all four new modules. Run it and `run_lake_build.bat` after
relevant changes. Keep the full goal active.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal runners reached terminal
exit 0 with zero Lean errors, warnings, tactic suggestions and linter
failures. The target audited 2,847 declarations (2,842 discovered
target theorems plus five imported contracts); all 27 new regressions
passed. Exact commands, logs, hashes and coverage are in the current
Reproduction Manifest. This verifies local-integral superlevel counting,
not pointwise zeta large values, the twelfth moment or Add-est.

## Point-entry kernels and literal zeta overlap — preceding checkpoint

The preserved Lemma 62 counterexample and the proved corrected two-witness
powering/Heath–Brown chain are unchanged. EPZAE-21 now additionally proves
the Gamma-kernel and bounded-overlap components needed for point-value entry.

For every 0<δ≤1/4 and a,b independently chosen from {δ,-δ}, the
literal product

```text
P(a,b,u,w) = |Gamma(a+i*w)| |Gamma(b+i*(u-w))|
```

is integrable in w, and a single absolute C>0 gives
`integral P <= (C/δ)*exp(-|u|)`. The public consumer
`exists_pointMeanGammaProduct_integral_le` derives integrability and
uses both proved shifted-Gamma bounds and the numerical convolution.
Its height-linked companion
`exists_pointMeanGammaProduct_log_integral_le` substitutes
δ=1/log(t), derives 0<δ≤1/4 from t≥exp(4), and proves
`integral P <= C*log(t)*exp(-|u|)`. Both displacement signs and
zero ordinate are retained; no Gamma or convolution estimate is assumed.

For a unit-separated finite W, the actual exponential kernels satisfy
`sum_(t in W) exp(-|t-u|) <= 4`. The moving-window consumer
`sum_truncated_exp_kernel_zeta_sq_le_localSecondMoment` proves

```text
sum_(t in W) integral_(t-L)^(t+L)
  exp(-|t-u|) |zeta(1/2+i*u)|^2 du
 <= 4 * integral_(center-G)^(center+G) |zeta(1/2+i*u)|^2 du.
```

It assumes G,L≥0, W⊂[center-G/2,center+G/2],
G/2+L≤G and unit separation. It derives every interval enlargement
and finite integral interchange. The cost is the absolute factor four,
not the cluster occupancy or the physical width G.

The previously proved local-integral superlevel count remains:
`card <= D*H^ν*(H/(G*Y^2)+H^2/Y^6)`, with all original physical
width restrictions, actual source errors, positive thresholds and
uniform constant dependencies retained. This new overlap theorem does
not yet connect pointwise zeta largeness to that count.

Eight root-reachable modules are installed: `PointMeanDigamma`,
`PointMeanGammaShift`, `PointMeanGammaDecay`, `PointMeanGammaKernel`,
`PointMeanGammaConvolution`, `PointMeanExponentialOverlap`,
`PointMeanIntegralOverlap` and `PointMeanGammaProduct`.
All 38 public theorems have named audits; 46 new regressions cover
their exact types and shell endpoints, empty sets, zero ordinates,
and the negative displacement. Seven modules adapt inspected node-74
proofs to the existing target/native imports and actual
`zetaMomentCriticalNorm`; the eighth supplies new literal Gamma consumers.
No adjacent package, dependency pin, source archive, or frozen foundation
has been changed.

ZGK is complete only for the literal Gamma convolution and its
height-linked logarithmic bound. ZEO is complete only for the actual
exponential local-integral overlap. The complete contour proof of
Heath–Brown Lemma 3 is NOT yet installed in this target. Its residue,
displaced zeta bounds, horizontal edges, truncated tail and compact range
remain to be assembled. Pointwise large-value counting also still needs
occupancy-aware clustering, compatible G selection and the lower-value
reduction. ZGB, ZAT, ZTM, unconditional Add-est, EPZAE-21/37 and the full
EPZAE-00–41 completion contract remain OPEN.

Preserve `EnergyPoweringObstruction.lean` byte-for-byte. Never restore
false s-scaling or a third s-preserving witness. The independent ρ/k and
ρ*/k witnesses and actual Heath–Brown application remain intact.
Maintain and update `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its backing
implementation as needed, including all eight modules in the exact
inventory. Run it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes.
Keep the full goal active.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal runners reached terminal
exit 0 with zero Lean errors, warnings, tactic suggestions or linter
failures. The target audited 2,890 declarations (2,885 discovered
target theorems plus five imported contracts); all 46 new regressions
passed. The foundation audit covered 14,290 declarations and its
manifest reports PASS with no failed stages. Exact logs and hashes
are in the current Reproduction Manifest. This verifies the Gamma
and overlap components, not the still-open pointwise zeta entry,
twelfth moment or unconditional Add-est.

## Heath–Brown point-to-local-mean entry — historical checkpoint

The original Lemma 62 counterexample is preserved byte-for-byte. The corrected
independent cardinality and energy witnesses, and their proved Heath–Brown
application, are unchanged. This checkpoint closes an analytic input to the
remaining zeta/Add-est branch; it does not change the frozen public outputs.

`heathBrownLemmaThree_native` now proves the complete source-shaped estimate:
one absolute C>0 works for every t≥10,

```text
|zeta(1/2+i*t)|^2
 <= C*log(t)*(1 + integral_(-log(t)^2)^(log(t)^2)
      exp(-|u|)*|zeta(1/2+i*(t+u))|^2 du).
```

The proposition and moment definitions unfold to this literal integral.
The proof derives the smoothed divisor Mellin identity, both pole residues,
the infinite shifts, both displaced-line estimates, the finite rectangle's
four edge bounds, the full-to-truncated tail estimate and the compact range.
The strong Gamma reserve makes the nested integral lose only δ⁻¹;
δ=1/log(t) is linked to the source height. None of these estimates is an
analytic hypothesis of the final theorem.

`heathBrown_equation44_native` consumes that theorem and the actual
factor-four exponential-overlap theorem. For R=card(W) it proves

```text
V^2*R <= C*log(T)*(R + 4*integral_(center-G)^(center+G)
                                  |zeta(1/2+i*u)|^2 du).
```

Here T≥10, V>0, G,L≥0; W is unit-separated and contained in
[center-G/2,center+G/2]⊂[10,T]; every t∈W has log(t)^2≤L;
G/2+L≤G; and every t∈W satisfies V≤|zeta(1/2+i*t)|.
All parameters follow the absolute constant. The final consumer has no
Lemma-3 hypothesis and does not discard cluster occupancy.

Nineteen additional production modules are root-reachable and included in
the exact inventory behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`.
There are 129 new public theorem audits and 136 new regressions, including
the unfolded literal source inequality and the endpoints t=10 and t=exp(4).
The adjacent node-74 proof bodies were inspected and adapted to existing
target/native imports; unrelated import chains were not added. No package
pin, source archive, counterexample or adjacent project was changed.

ZL3 is complete for the full source Lemma 3; ZQ44 is complete for its
literal finite peak-to-local-integral consumer. ZGB still needs constructed
occupancy-aware clusters, compatible physical width selection, absorption
of the actual local-source error, and the remaining value ranges.
The installed local-integral superlevel count still has its original
fourth-root width restrictions. ZAT, ZTM, unconditional Add-est,
EPZAE-21/37 and the full EPZAE-00–41 goal remain OPEN.

Keep the complete goal active. Preserve `EnergyPoweringObstruction.lean`
and the independent fifth coordinates; never reintroduce false s-scaling
or a third s-preserving witness. Maintain the principal
`run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`, its backing implementation, root imports,
exact inventory, audits and regressions as the proof grows. After relevant
changes, run both it and the foundation's `run_lake_build.bat`.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal scripts were polled to terminal
exit 0. The target reports `LEAN VERIFICATION PASS`, covering all 299
package files and 3,104 audited declarations (3,099 discovered target
theorems plus five imported contracts). All 129 new named audits and
136 new regressions pass. The foundation reports `PASS`, with 14,290
discovered theorems audited and all six stages passed. Neither final
evaluation has a Lean error, warning, tactic suggestion or linter failure.
Exact logs, hashes and the repaired intermediate comment-scan failure are
recorded in the current Reproduction Manifest. The counterexample hash is
unchanged. This verifies Lemma 3 and the finite point-entry consumer;
occupancy-aware counting, the genuine twelfth moment, unconditional Add-est
and the full goal remain open.

## Occupancy-preserving peak count and derived growth — historical checkpoint

The printed Lemma 62 counterexample is still byte-preserved. The proved
corrected two-witness powering, independent fifth coordinates and actual
Heath–Brown energy application are unchanged.

Three additional EPZAE-21 consumers are now proved:

- `exists_pointValue_card_le_with_width` counts the original unit-separated
  zeta peaks, retaining every cluster occupancy. Half-G floor bins keep
  occupied centers in [H,2H], including the terminal endpoint. Both parity
  classes are G-separated. The actual equation-(44) entry and Atkinson
  excess count bound each occupancy superlevel; exact layer-cake summation
  and the inverse-square sum recover all points with no factor G loss.
- `exists_pointValue_card_le_source_range` constructs
  G=V²/(K log(3H)²), absorbs the actual source error and derives all window
  and width conditions. For δ,κ,ν>0 with δ≤1/4, there are K,D>0 and H₀≥40000,
  chosen before H,V,W, such that for H≥H₀ and V>0,
  `K log(3H)² (2H)^(1/4+κ) ≤ V² ≤ K log(3H)² H^(1/2−δ)`,
  every unit-separated W⊂[H,2H] with |ζ(1/2+it)|≥V satisfies
  `card(W) ≤ D H^ν (H log(3H)^4/V^6 + H² log(3H)^6/V^12)`.
  The fourth-root margin is retained, not removed.
- `exists_zetaMomentCriticalNorm_lt_sixth_power` proves that for every ε>0
  there is H₀≥40000 such that H≥H₀ and H≤t≤2H imply
  |ζ(1/2+it)|<H^(1/6+ε). A singleton peak at H^(1/6+η),
  η=min(ε,1/48), satisfies the proved source range but its cardinality bound
  is eventually less than one. This derives the actual zeta growth estimate;
  it does not assume one or substitute a Dirichlet-block estimate.

The six modules `FiniteOccupancy`, `PointClusters`, `PointClusterEntry`,
`PointClusterCounting`, `PointValueWidth` and `PointValueGrowth` are covered
by the root and exact production inventory. Their 29 public theorems have
named audits, and 37 added regressions check every public type plus actual
endpoints, occupancy, parity and the unfolded zeta-growth conclusion.

Architecture nodes ZOC, ZVW and ZPG record these exact consumers as DONE.
ZGB remains OPEN for the remaining value-range reductions and their
moment-ready aggregation. ZAT's smaller-width/source-form bridge, the genuine
dyadic twelfth moment ZTM, all unconditional Add-est clauses, EPZAE-19/21/37
and the full EPZAE-00–41 goal remain OPEN. This critical-line growth result
does not complete the distinct exponent-pair-to-mu contract EPZAE-15.

Maintain `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its backing implementation as
needed: root imports, exact inventory, named/exhaustive audits and regressions
must grow together. Run both principal scripts after relevant changes.
Preserve the counterexample and do not restore false s-scaling or a third
s-preserving witness. No dependency pin, source archive or adjacent proof
was changed in this checkpoint.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal runners reached terminal exit 0.
The target reports `LEAN VERIFICATION PASS`: 305 package files, 316 Lean
files in its integrity scan, 3,187 audited declarations (3,182 discovered
target theorems plus five imported contracts), all 29 new named audits and
all 37 added regressions passed. The foundation reports `PASS`: all six
stages passed and 14,290 discovered theorems audited. Both final evaluations
have zero Lean errors, warnings, tactic suggestions or linter failures.
The counterexample SHA256 is unchanged. Exact logs, hashes and repaired
focused-build diagnostics are recorded in the current Reproduction Manifest.
This verifies the occupancy/width consumers and actual critical-line growth,
not the genuine twelfth moment, unconditional Add-est or the full goal.

## High-value twelfth moment and fourth-moment reduction — historical checkpoint

The printed Lemma 62 counterexample is preserved byte-for-byte. Corrected
cardinality/energy powering, the independent ρ/k and ρ*/k witnesses with
independent fifth exponents, and the actual Heath–Brown energy application
remain unchanged.

The following actual-zeta consumers are now proved. Write
S(H,V)={t∈[H,2H] : |ζ(1/2+it)|≥V}. For every ε>0 and sufficiently large H,
uniformly for V≥H^(1/8+ε):

- `exists_pointValue_twelfth_weighted_card_le` gives
  card(W) V^12≤H^(2+ε) for every unit-separated W⊂S(H,V).
  There is no upper-amplitude hypothesis: the proved actual growth estimate
  controls that range, and the source-width and logarithmic margins are paid.
- `exists_volume_pointValueSuperlevel_le` gives
  volume(S(H,V))≤2H^(2+ε)/V^12. A maximal finite separated family is
  constructed from the proved cardinality bound; its closed unit balls
  cover the entire superlevel set, with the factor two accounted for.
- `exists_zeta_twelfth_high_integral_le` proves
  integral over S(H,H^(1/8+ε)) of |ζ(1/2+it)|^12≤H^(2+ε).
  The actual measure bound, actual height-cube bound for |ζ|^12 and exact
  logarithmic layer-cake integral are composed without analytic hypotheses.

`zeta_twelfth_integral_le_high_add_fourth` proves the exact low/high
reduction: the full twelfth moment on [H,2H] is at most the high-set
integral plus V^8 times the unweighted fourth moment on [H,2H].
`zeta_twelfth_dyadic_of_fourth` performs the full deduction but is
explicitly CONDITIONAL on the genuine upstream estimate

```text
for every η>0 there exist C≥0 and H₀, chosen before H, such that
H≥H₀ and H>0 imply integral_H^(2H) |ζ(1/2+it)|^4 dt ≤ C H^(1+η).
```

That unweighted fourth-moment instance is still OPEN. The foundation's
`twistedZetaFourthMoment_native` instead bounds the fourth power of a
short Möbius polynomial multiplied by ζ; its factor cannot simply be
removed. No mollified result is claimed to prove the unweighted estimate.

The six modules `PointValueRanges`, `PointValueMeasure`,
`TruncatedLayerCake`, `PointValueTailIntegral`,
`PointValueHighMoment` and `PointValueLowMoment` are in the root and exact
production inventory. All 24 public theorems have named audits; 30 new
regressions cover their exact signatures, boundary cases and the literal
high-value zeta integral. ZHR/ZHM and the reduction ZLF are DONE; ZGB now
identifies the missing genuine fourth-moment source theorem. ZTM, ZAT,
EPZAE-19/21/37, unconditional Add-est and the full EPZAE-00–41 goal remain OPEN.
No other frozen public output or acceptance test is weakened.

Maintain `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its backing implementation
as needed, including root imports, exact module coverage, named/exhaustive
audits and regressions. Run both principal scripts after relevant changes.
Preserve the counterexample, never restore false s-scaling or a third
s-preserving witness, and keep the full goal active. No source pin,
archive or adjacent/native proof was changed in this checkpoint.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal scripts reached terminal exit 0.
The target reports `LEAN VERIFICATION PASS`: 311 package files, 322 Lean
files in its integrity scan, 3,232 audited declarations (3,227 discovered
target theorems plus five imported contracts). All 24 new named audits
and all 30 added regressions pass. The foundation reports `PASS`: all six
stages passed, with 14,290 discovered theorems audited. Both final
evaluations have zero Lean errors, warnings, tactic suggestions or linter
failures. The counterexample SHA256 is unchanged; source and runner hashes
were rechecked after both gates. Exact logs, hashes and repaired focused
diagnostics are in the current Reproduction Manifest. These gates verify
the high-value bound and explicitly conditional fourth-moment deduction,
not the missing fourth-moment instance, unconditional Add-est or full goal.

## Actual fourth-moment contour bounds and mixed-line truncation — historical checkpoint

The printed Lemma 62 counterexample is preserved byte-for-byte. The
authorized corrected cardinality/energy powering, independent ρ/k and
ρ*/k witnesses (with independent fifth exponents), and actual Heath–Brown
energy application remain unchanged. False s-scaling is not restored.

The new source is genuinely unweighted zeta. Write
J(t)=zetaSquareDivisorIntegral(-t)/zetaSquareGammaNormalization(t).
`zetaSquareNorm_eq_two_re_fourthRightPiece` proves
|ζ(1/2+it)|²=2 Re J(t), and `zeta_fourth_le_four_mul_rightPiece_sq`
proves |ζ|⁴≤4|J|². The actual Gamma quotient and pole factors are retained;
the native mollified fourth-moment theorem is not substituted.

`exists_norm_zetaFourthKernel_le` proves, for each c>0, a constant K_c>0
chosen before t and u such that t≥4 and t≥4c imply
|K(t,c+iu)|≤K_c t^c exp(-98u²) on the complete line. Near-height
Gronwall bounds and far-height Gamma bounds are both consumed.
A separate, height-dependent strip bound justifies holomorphy,
integrability and disappearing horizontal sides; it is not advertised
as the uniform moment bound.

`zetaFourthContribution_line_eq` proves equality of each actual
integrated ordinary-divisor contribution on any two positive lines.
`hasSum_zetaFourthContribution` transports the convergent integrated
series from c=1. This does NOT assert pointwise Dirichlet-series
convergence to the left of its half-plane.

For t≥0, a,b>0 and any finite S, the actual source now satisfies
J(t)=Prefix(t,a,S)+Tail(t,b,S). The prefix is proved equal to the
integral of the finite ordinary-divisor polynomial times the actual kernel.
For b>3/2, one constant K_b>0 works for all t≥max(4,4b) and all S:
|Tail|≤K_b t^b Σ_(n∉S) d(n)n^(-1/2-b).
The displayed positive tail is summable, not an assumed small error.
`exists_zeta_fourth_le_prefix_add_weightTail` consumes these results
to bound the literal |ζ|⁴ by eight times the squared prefix norm plus
eight times the squared displayed tail bound.

Twelve new `ZetaFourth*` modules are root-reachable and in the exact
production inventory; 53 public theorems have named dependency audits.
Sixty new regressions cover every signature, zero/empty/singleton cases,
different contour lines and literal critical-zeta consumers. The final
principal-runner evidence is recorded below.

Z4K (uniform kernel) and Z4C (actual mixed-line truncation) are supporting
results, not the unweighted fourth-moment theorem. ZGB still requires the
finite-polynomial mean square, quantitative cutoff-tail decay and their
integrated assembly. Thus ZGB/ZTM/ZAT, EPZAE-19/21/37, unconditional Add-est
and the full EPZAE-00–41 goal remain OPEN. No frozen public contract is
weakened, and no source pin, archive or adjacent/native proof is changed.

Maintain `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its backing implementation
as needed: exact module coverage, root imports, named/exhaustive audits and
regressions are part of the goal. Run it and `run_lake_build.bat` after
relevant changes; a passing audit establishes integrity, not completion
of the missing moment or of all advertised Add-est clauses.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal scripts reached terminal exit 0.
The target reports `LEAN VERIFICATION PASS`: 323 package files, 334 Lean
files in its integrity scan, 3,296 audited declarations (3,291 discovered
target theorems plus five imported contracts). All 53 new named audits
and 60 added regressions pass. The foundation reports `PASS`: all six
stages passed and 14,290 discovered theorems audited. Both final
evaluations have zero Lean errors, warnings, tactic suggestions or linter
failures. The counterexample is byte-preserved; all source/runner hashes
were rechecked after both gates. Exact logs, hashes and the repaired
comment-scanner false positive are in the current Reproduction Manifest.
These gates verify the actual contour and truncation consumers, not the
missing fourth-moment integral, unconditional Add-est or the full goal.

## Unweighted moments and Add-est (i) — historical checkpoint

The printed Lemma 62 singleton counterexample is preserved byte-for-byte.
The corrected theorem still returns independent ρ/k and ρ*/k witnesses,
with independent existential fifth coordinates. No false s'/s scaling or
third s-preserving witness is restored.

`zeta_fourth_dyadic` now proves the genuine unweighted estimate: for every
η>0, constants C≥0 and H₀ are chosen before H, and H≥H₀, H>0 imply
integral_H^(2H) |ζ(1/2+it)|⁴ ≤ C H^(1+η).
It consumes the actual normalized divisor-contour source, not the native
mollified fourth moment and not an assumed fourth-moment bound.

The finite prefix is exactly {1,...,2^M}, including its first coefficient.
Unit-modulus endpoint twists prove a mean square uniform under every real
imaginary translation u, including the reflected phase u-t. The ordinary
divisor coefficient-square bound is derived from the native divisor bound.
Weighted Cauchy–Schwarz, product integrability and Fubini are proved for the
actual Gaussian kernel and complete finite polynomial.

The separate right line b=2+2/δ gives an actual bounded tail when
N≥H^(1+δ), uniformly for H≤t≤2H. A dyadic N between H^(1+q) and
2H^(1+q), with q=min(η,1)/20, pays the block-count loss. The exact exponent
1+5q+2q² is at most 1+7q≤1+η. Neither the cutoff error nor the polynomial
mean square remains a theorem parameter.

`zeta_twelfth_dyadic` applies the installed high/low decomposition to this
proved fourth moment. For every ε>0 it gives constants D≥0 and H₀ before H:
integral_H^(2H) |ζ(1/2+it)|¹² ≤ D H^(2+ε).
`zetaTwelfth_largeValueBound` and its short-height companion discharge
the actual Perron consumers: LV_ζ≤2τ−12(σ−1/2) for σ≥1/2, τ≥2,
and for σ≥3/4, τ≥3/2, respectively.

`add_est_i` in `NewAdditiveEnergy.lean` proves the literal printed clause on the entire
closed interval 3/4≤σ≤5/6:

```text
A*(σ)(1−σ) ≤ max((18−19σ)/(2(3σ−1)), 4(10−9σ)/(5(4σ−1))).
```

The actual declarations are `add_est_i`, `add_est_i_bound` and
`add_est_i_zero_energy` in `NewAdditiveEnergy.lean`.
The last exposes ∀ε>0 ∃C≥1 ∃δ>0 ∀T≥C, with the genuine shifted zero
energy at σ−δ, preserving analytic multiplicities and unit tolerance.
The epsilon--delta bound is proved first; the extended-real infimum
inequality is its consequence, not a substitute. At σ=3/4 the rate is
3/2 and A*≤6; at σ=5/6 the rate is 6/7 and A*≤36/7.

The dependency chain consumes corrected powering, the actual Heath–Brown
energy relation, certified general/zeta optimization, the proved twelfth
moment, and the proved endpoint-one zero-energy transfer. The separate
EPZAE-33 endpoint-two theorem is not assumed and remains open.

Seventeen new production modules are root-reachable and explicitly listed
in the batch runner's inventory. All 49 new public theorems have named
dependency audits. Sixty-one new regressions cover every public signature,
literal zeta integrals, coefficient/prefix endpoints, negative translated
intervals, both LV threshold boundaries and both printed energy endpoints.

ZGB, ZTM and clause (i)'s actual zeta/short-energy consumers are proved.
The other eight Add-est clauses, their remaining optimization certificates,
the separate sharp Atkinson source-form theorem, the other EPZAE-19/21
inputs, and the exponent-pair/density outputs remain OPEN. EPZAE-36/37 and
the full EPZAE-00–41 goal are not complete; the frozen contract is unchanged.

Keep `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat` and its backing implementation
synchronized with root imports, exact inventory, named/exhaustive audits
and regressions. Run it and `run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes.
This checkpoint's terminal gate evidence is recorded in the Reproduction
Manifest; earlier checkpoint PASS records are historical.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal BAT scripts reached terminal
exit 0. The target reports LEAN VERIFICATION PASS: 340 package files,
351 integrity-scanned Lean files and 3,357 audited declarations
(3,352 discovered target theorems plus five imported contracts).
All 49 new named audits and all 61 new regressions pass.
The foundation reports PASS: all six stages passed, with 14,290
discovered theorems audited. Both final logs contain zero Lean errors,
warnings, tactic suggestions or linter failures. The counterexample
SHA256 is unchanged. Exact logs, source/runner hashes and repaired
focused diagnostics are recorded in the current Reproduction Manifest.
These gates verify the genuine moments and full-domain Add-est (i),
not clauses (ii)--(ix) or completion of the full goal.

## Add-est (ii): repaired powering to actual zero energy — verified checkpoint

Printed Lemma 62 remains disproved. Its singleton counterexample is
byte-preserved (SHA256 `76301acb24e912c76557d9b02dce8a3f50cbb2c953d5578743a069d70949a487`).
The authorized replacement still uses independent cardinality-preserving
ρ/k and energy-preserving ρ*/k witnesses with independent existential fifth
coordinates. No false s'/s scaling or third witness is restored.

`add_est_ii`, `add_est_ii_bound`, and `add_est_ii_zero_energy` in
`NewAdditiveEnergy.lean` prove the complete second printed clause on
the closed interval 7/10 ≤ σ ≤ 3/4:

```text
A*(σ)(1−σ) ≤ max(5(18−19σ)/(2(5σ+3)), 2(45−44σ)/(2σ+15)).
```

The actual shifted-zero epsilon--delta bound is proved first, with analytic
multiplicity and unit-tolerance energy retained. The extended-real
infimum inequality follows from it. At σ=7/10 the rate is 47/26 and
A*≤235/39; at σ=3/4 the rate is 16/11 and A*≤64/11.
These endpoint checks supplement, not replace, the full interval proof.

For general patterns, `energyClauseTwo_general_bound` proves the rate on
2≤τ≤4. Actual mean-square and Guth--Maynard cardinality consumers use the
ρ/k witness at k and k+1. The actual Heath--Brown relation uses independent
energy witnesses at k and k−1, where k is two or three. All nine affine
branches are checked; the exceptional branches consume the first powered
energy inequality. Every height and coordinate is linked to its original
region point. Compactness promotes the region result to a uniform bound.

For zeta patterns, sixth-order decay is applied to the actual critical
Mellin integrand. Both the residue and the complete far tail
240 C₆ N^(11/2)/T⁴ are retained before absorption at T≥N^(11/8).
`zetaTwelfth_lower_short_largeValueBound` consumes the proved dyadic
twelfth moment and this entry bridge for σ≥7/10, τ≥7/5.
Actual cancellation gives eventual emptiness for 1≤τ<2σ on the clause
interval; mean-square powering and the twelfth-moment cap handle
2σ≤τ≤2 through nine exact branches with crossing τ=4σ−1.
`energyClauseTwo_short_zeta` therefore supplies all of [1,2].

`energyClauseTwo` composes the two uniform ranges with the already proved
endpoint-one bounded-range zero-energy transfer. The separate printed
endpoint-two transfer (EPZAE-33) is neither assumed nor marked complete.
Clause (i) remains proved. Clauses (iii)--(ix), the remaining optimization
projections, the source-form sharp Atkinson obligation, the other
EPZAE-19/21 inputs, and the exponent-pair/density/release outputs remain OPEN.
EPZAE-36/37 and the full EPZAE-00–41 objective are unchanged and incomplete.

Eleven new production modules are root-reachable and explicitly included
in the principal runner inventory. Eighty-four new public theorems have
named dependency audits; 92 added regressions cover all signatures and
literal physical/source endpoints. Keep `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`
and its backing inventory synchronized; run it and `run_lake_build.bat`
after relevant changes. Current gate evidence belongs in the Reproduction
Manifest; earlier PASS records are historical.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal BATs reached terminal exit 0.
The target reports LEAN VERIFICATION PASS: 351 package files, 362
integrity-scanned Lean files and 3,504 audited declarations (3,499 discovered
target theorems plus five imported contracts). All 84 new named audits and
92 new regressions pass. The foundation reports PASS: all six stages passed
and all 14,290 discovered theorems were audited. Final logs contain zero
Lean errors, warnings, tactic suggestions or linter failures. The
counterexample and all 18 recorded source/runner hashes were rechecked.
Exact log paths and hashes appear in the current Reproduction Manifest.
These gates verify full-domain Add-est (ii), not the other seven clauses or
completion of the unchanged whole-proof goal.

## Jutila source entry and uniform powered moments — verified checkpoint

The printed Lemma 62 counterexample is preserved unchanged. Corrected
independent cardinality and energy witnesses remain the only powering
replacement. Full Add-est (i) and (ii) remain proved; (iii)--(ix) remain OPEN.

Four new production modules advance the missing EPZAE-19 Jutila input:
`JutilaGram`, `JutilaPatternEntry`, `JutilaPoweredMoments`, and
`JutilaReflectedEntry`. They do **not** yet prove Jutila's large-values
estimate or another Add-est clause.

`jutila_smooth_amplified_gram` proves actual phase-aligned smoothed duality,
removes the diagonal before Hölder, and gives, for every positive integer k,
either R V² ≤ 2N² or R² V^(4k) ≤ (2N)^(2k) times the actual off-diagonal
2k-th trace moment. No moment or cardinality bound is assumed.

`LargeValuePattern.jutila_gram_entry` consumes an actual source pattern.
Its fixed smoothed subfamily retains at least a third of the ordinates,
the exact threshold (V−1)/3, unit separation, the actual height, and
N/2 ≤ Q ≤ 2N. The spaced consumer keeps the explicit packing loss
6(2⌈δ⌉+1). `jutila_reflected_pattern_entry` then consumes complete native
reflection on that same subfamily, with one common dual cutoff M.
The main factor uses the actual |u−t|. Mellin truncation, omitted-frequency,
and zero-mode errors all remain in `jutilaReflectionEnvelope`.

`jutila_weighted_power_moment_uniform` proves the actual critical-line
2k-th ordered-difference moment bound. With U=2^k N^k and R=|W|, its RHS is
C (U^η)² T^ε (R² + R U + R^(5/4) T^(1/2)).
C and the height threshold depend only on k, ε, η, and are chosen before
N, T, W. The proof consumes the uniform divisor bound, actual powered
coefficients, dyadic decomposition, coefficient majorant, and the proved
native weighted Heath--Brown theorem. That second-moment theorem is an
input to this deduction, not a substitute for Jutila's large-values theorem.

Remaining: pass from complete reflected prefixes to uniformly bounded
powered difference moments, sum the reflected integrals with all errors,
and perform the local-to-global large-values optimization. Then establish
the actual region and uniform exponent consumers before using them in the
seven remaining energy optimizations. EPZAE-19, 33, 36, 37 and the full
EPZAE-00–41 goal remain open; the distinct endpoint-two transfer, source-form
sharp Atkinson obligation, and other exponent-pair/density/release tasks
are unchanged.

The four modules are included in the root and the exact production
inventory of `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`. Thirteen new public theorems
have named audits and sixteen regressions cover their exact signatures,
literal diagonal removal, the k=13 power, and all reflected error terms.
Keep that BAT and its backing inventory synchronized, and execute it and
`run_lake_build.bat` after relevant changes. Terminal verification evidence
for this checkpoint is recorded below and in the Reproduction Manifest.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal BAT runners reached terminal exit 0.
The target reports LEAN VERIFICATION PASS: 355 package files, 366
integrity-scanned Lean files, and 3,530 audited declarations (3,525 discovered
target theorems plus five imported contracts). All 13 new named audits and
16 new regressions pass. The foundation reports PASS: all six stages passed
and all 14,290 discovered theorems were audited. Final logs contain zero
Lean errors, warnings, tactic suggestions, or linter failures. All eleven
recorded source/runner hashes were rechecked unchanged after the gates,
including the original counterexample. Repository scans found no forbidden
proof terms; the twelve raw postulate-pattern matches are the same ten
comments and two rational structure fields already reviewed. Git
`diff --check` passes (Git's LF/CRLF notices are not Lean diagnostics).
Exact commands, logs and hashes are in the Reproduction Manifest.
These gates verify the Jutila entry and powered-moment inputs, not the
remaining Jutila large-values theorem, other seven Add-est clauses, or
completion of the unchanged whole-proof goal.

## Jutila reflected-prefix moments and near/far assembly — verified history

The printed Lemma 62 counterexample is preserved unchanged. The corrected
independent cardinality and energy witnesses remain the only powering
replacement. Full Add-est (i) and (ii) remain proved; (iii)--(ix) remain OPEN.

Six new production modules advance EPZAE-19: `JutilaPolynomialMoments`,
`JutilaPrefixMoments`, `JutilaReflectionIntegrals`, `JutilaTraceBins`,
`JutilaBinnedPatterns`, and `JutilaHybridPatterns`.

`jutila_source_power_moment_uniform` handles arbitrary unit coefficients,
with constants chosen before their values and the physical length.
`jutila_reflected_prefix_moment_uniform` consumes the actual complete
reflected prefix, including n=1. With U=(2M)^k, R=|W|, and L=ceil(log₂ M),
its bound is C (L+1)^(2k) U (U^η)² T^ε
(R² + R U + R^(5/4) T^(1/2)). The constant is uniform in M, T, W and
the translation parameter. Neither the initial term nor a power of U is
discarded.

`jutila_reflected_bin_integral_moment_uniform` applies interval Jensen and
the proved full ordered-pair majorant before restricting to a difference
bin. Its extra interval factor is exactly (2H)^(2k).
`jutila_binned_pattern_bound` connects those estimates to the actual
source pattern, with bin-dependent positive dual lengths and all Mellin,
omitted-frequency, and zero-mode errors retained.

`jutila_hybrid_pattern_bound` additionally consumes native square-root
cancellation of the complete nonzero Poisson tail below the stationary
scale, keeping the separate zero-mode decay. Above that scale it uses the
actual ceiling length max(1,ceil(2^j H/Q)). The same subfamily retains
the packing loss 6(2 ceil(δ)+1), threshold (V−1)/3, N/2 ≤ Q ≤ 2N, the
actual height, and δ-separation. The condition 4H ≤ δ derives reflection
admissibility on occupied bins; it is not an independently assumed bin
estimate. The three new majorant definitions are notation, not proofs.

Remaining: bound this explicit near/far sum at source scale, absorb all
errors and logarithmic losses uniformly, perform the local-to-global
large-values optimization, and prove the exponent/energy-region consumers.
The target remains
LV(σ,τ) ≤ max(2−2σ, τ+4−2/k−(6−2/k)σ, τ+(6−8σ)k), k ≥ 1.
Only then can k=13 enter Add-est (iii) and the other remaining optimizations.
EPZAE-19, 33, 36, 37 and the full EPZAE-00–41 goal remain open. The distinct
endpoint-two transfer, sharp source-form Atkinson bridge, exponent-pair,
density, and release obligations are unchanged.

All six modules are root-imported and included in the exact inventory
behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`. Seventeen new public theorems have
named audits; 23 regressions cover their exact signatures, the n=1 term at
k=13, zero interval width, the literal ceiling, and both schedule branches.
Both that BAT and `run_lake_build.bat` remain required evaluation gates.
This is finite-scale proof progress, not completion of Jutila or another
Add-est clause.

Verification (2026-09-21): both principal BAT runners reached terminal
exit 0. The target reports LEAN VERIFICATION PASS: 361 package files, 372
integrity-scanned Lean files, and 3,564 audited declarations (3,559 discovered
target theorems plus five imported contracts). All 17 new named audits and
23 regressions pass. The foundation reports PASS: all six stages passed,
with 14,290 discovered theorems audited. Final logs contain zero Lean
errors, warnings, tactic suggestions, or linter failures. All seventeen
recorded source/build hashes are unchanged after the gates, including the
original counterexample. Repository scans find no forbidden proof terms;
the twelve raw postulate-pattern matches are the previously reviewed ten
comments and two rational structure fields. Git `diff --check` passes.
Exact commands, logs, hashes, and the corrected initial scan failure are
recorded in the Reproduction Manifest. These checks certify the stated
finite-scale scope, not the remaining Jutila exponent, seven Add-est
clauses, or completion of the unchanged whole-proof goal.

## Jutila physical-scale smoothing and uniform pattern bounds — current checkpoint

The printed Lemma 62 counterexample remains byte-for-byte unchanged. The
authorized independent cardinality and energy witnesses remain the powering
replacement. Full Add-est (i) and (ii) remain proved; (iii)--(ix) remain OPEN.

Seven new production modules advance EPZAE-19: `JutilaDualScales`,
`JutilaPhysicalMain`, `JutilaPhysicalPatterns`, `JutilaSmoothingErrors`,
`JutilaSmoothingProfile`, `JutilaSmoothingLosses`, and
`JutilaSmoothedPatterns`.

`jutila_reflection_main_core_le` cancels each actual powered dual length
against its own displacement denominator before imposing the common cap.
`jutila_physical_pattern_bound` consumes the complete near/far pattern
theorem, retaining all main terms, logarithmic/divisor costs, and sharp
reflection errors. The common ceiling is used only for losses.

Native smoothing uses H=max(1,ceil(T^θ)) and derivative order
q=max(2,ceil(4/θ)+1). The zero mode and all three reflection errors are
controlled by proved native estimates, not assumed numerical certificates.
The smoothing-error bridge explicitly requires Q≤2T. The complete profile
is uniformly O(T^(2θ)); its full powered cost, including the bin count,
is O(T^((16k+3)θ)). The actual thinning cost is at most 108 T^θ.

`jutila_smoothed_pattern_bound` chooses positive B and T₀≥2 before every
actual `LargeValuePattern`. For scale≥30, V>1, T≥T₀, and **N≤T**, it
constructs a subset W of the reflected ordinates and Q with N/2≤Q≤2N.
Writing R=|W| and V'=(V−1)/3, the original count is at most B T^ν R,
W is 1-separated in the actual height interval, and either

- R (V')² ≤ 2Q²; or
- R² (V')^(4k) ≤ B T^ν (2Q)^(2k)
  (R²Q^k + R T^k + R^(5/4) T^(1/2) Q^k).

This holds for every k≥1 and ν>0. The choice of θ absorbs both losses
without changing the physical height or assuming the desired LV estimate.
The N≤T restriction derives Q≤2T and is not silently removed.

Remaining: solve the cardinality recurrence with its value threshold,
cover the complementary short-height range, perform the local-to-global
optimization, and prove the actual uniform LV and energy-region consumers.
The unchanged target is
LV(σ,τ) ≤ max(2−2σ, τ+4−2/k−(6−2/k)σ, τ+(6−8σ)k).
Only then can k=13 enter Add-est (iii) and the other seven-clause work.
EPZAE-19, 33, 36, 37 and the whole EPZAE-00–41 goal remain open. The
distinct endpoint-two transfer, sharp source-form Atkinson, exponent-pair,
density and release obligations are unchanged.

All seven modules are root-imported and included in the exact inventory
behind `run_tao_trudgian_yang_build.bat`. Twenty-one new public theorems
have named audits. Twenty-seven regressions cover every exact signature
plus the actual k=13 source-pattern consumer, its three literal terms,
the empty-family boundary, ceiling padding, genuine zero-mode decay,
and the derived thinning cost. Both that BAT and `run_lake_build.bat`
remain mandatory; build integrity is separate from source completeness.
